It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] Such machines may be called AIs. High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."[2][3] Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] General intelligence the ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal level is among the field's long-term goals.[4] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[5] Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[6] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history,[7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters.[9][10] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques.[11] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture,[12] and by the early 2020s many billions of dollars were being invested in AI and the field experienced rapid ongoing progress in what has become known as the AI boom. The emergence of advanced generative AI in the midst of the AI boom and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about the risks of AI and its long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. Goals The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.[a] Reasoning and problem-solving Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[13] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[14] Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a "combinatorial explosion": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow.[15] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[16] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem. Knowledge representation An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering[17] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[18] scene interpretation,[19] clinical decision support,[20] knowledge discovery (mining "interesting" and actionable inferences from large databases),[21] and other areas.[22] A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.[23] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;[24] situations, events, states, and time;[25] causes and effects;[26] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);[27] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);[28] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[29] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as "facts" or "statements" that they could express verbally).[16] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.[c] Planning and decision-making An "agent" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.[d][32] In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal.[33] In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the "utility") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the "expected utility": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.[34] In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.[35] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is "unknown" or "unobservable") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not "deterministic"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.[36] In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.[37] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.[38] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.[39] Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.[40] Learning Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.[41] It has been a part of AI from the beginning.[e] There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[44] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).[45] In reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as "good".[46] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[47] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.[48] Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[49] Natural language processing Natural language processing (NLP)[50] allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English. Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.[51] Early work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation[f] unless restricted to small domains called "micro-worlds" (due to the common sense knowledge problem[29]). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning),[52] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism),[53] and others.[54] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or "GPT") language models began to generate coherent text,[55][56] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.[57] Perception Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.[58] The field includes speech recognition,[59] image classification,[60] facial recognition, object recognition,[61]object tracking,[62] and robotic perception.[63] Social intelligence Kismet, a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions.[64] Affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood.[65] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human computer interaction. However, this tends to give na ve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents.[66] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject.[67] General intelligence A machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.[4] Techniques AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.[b] Search and optimization AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[68] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search. State space search State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.[69] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.[70] Simple exhaustive searches[71] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes.[15] "Heuristics" or "rules of thumb" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.[72] Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position.[73] Local search Illustration of gradient descent for 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function (the height) Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.[74] Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks,[75] through the backpropagation algorithm. Another type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by "mutating" and "recombining" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.[76] Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).[77] Logic Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.[78] Formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as "and", "or", "not" and "implies")[79] and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as "Every X is a Y" and "There are some Xs that are Ys").[80] Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises).[81] Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules. Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem.[82] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.[83] Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages.[84] Fuzzy logic assigns a "degree of truth" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.[85] Non-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning.[28] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning A simple Bayesian network, with the associated conditional probability tables Many problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[86] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,[87] and information value theory.[88] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes,[89] dynamic decision networks,[90] game theory and mechanism design.[91] Bayesian networks[92] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),[g][94] learning (using the expectation maximization algorithm),[h][96] planning (using decision networks)[97] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[90] Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).[90] Expectation maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption. Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., "if shiny then diamond"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., "if diamond then pick up"), on the other hand. Classifiers[98] are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an "observation") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.[45] There are many kinds of classifiers in use.[99] The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.[100] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.[101] The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the "most widely used learner"[102] at Google, due in part to its scalability.[103] Neural networks are also used as classifiers.[104] Artificial neural networks A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain. An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.[104] Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.[105] Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.[106] In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction.[107] Recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks.[108] Perceptrons[109] use only a single layer of neurons; deep learning[110] uses multiple layers. Convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are "close" to each other this is especially important in image processing, where a local set of neurons must identify an "edge" before the network can identify an object.[111] Deep learning Deep learning[110] uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.[112] Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification,[113] and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021.[114] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012 2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)[i] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.[j] GPT Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called "hallucinations". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems.[122] Such systems are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text.[123][124] Current models and services include Gemini (formerly Bard), ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Copilot, and LLaMA.[125] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound, and text.[126] Hardware and software Main articles: Programming languages for artificial intelligence and Hardware for artificial intelligence In the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training.[127] Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research,[128] but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant.[129] The transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 months a trend known as Moore's law, named after the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, who first identified it. Improvements in GPUs have been even faster,[130] a trend sometimes called Huang's law,[131] named after Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang. Applications Main article: Applications of artificial intelligenceAI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple's Face ID or Microsoft's DeepFace and Google's FaceNet) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's iPhoto and TikTok). The deployment of AI may be overseen by a Chief automation officer (CAO). Health and medicine Main article: Artificial intelligence in healthcare The application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life.[132] Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.[133][134] For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data. This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication.[135] It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research.[135][136] New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein.[137] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria.[138] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.[139][140] Games Main article: Game artificial intelligence Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques.[141] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[142] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[143] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world.[144] Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus.[145] DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games.[146] In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map.[147] In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning.[148] In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.[149] Mathematics Large language models, such as GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, LLaMa or Mistral, are increasingly used in mathematics. These probabilistic models are versatile, but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations. They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning[150] or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections.[151] A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data.[152] One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps, rather than just the correct result.[153] The Alibaba Group developed a version of its Qwen models called Qwen2-Math, that achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks, including 84% accuracy on the MATH dataset of competition mathematics problems.[154] In January 2025, Microsoft proposed the technique rStar-Math that leverages Monte Carlo tree search and step-by-step reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model like Qwen-7B to solve 53% of the AIME 2024 and 90% of the MATH benchmark problems.[155] Alternatively, dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry and AlphaProof all from Google DeepMind,[156] Llemma from EleutherAI[157] or Julius.[158] When natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematical tasks. Some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics.[159] Topological deep learning integrates various topological approaches. Finance Finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated "robot advisers" have been in use for some years.[160] According to Nicolas Firzli, director of the World Pensions & Investments Forum, it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services. He argues that "the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but I'm not sure it will unleash a new wave of [e.g., sophisticated] pension innovation."[161] Military Main article: Military applications of artificial intelligence Various countries are deploying AI military applications.[162] The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability.[163] Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles.[162] AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles, both human operated and autonomous.[163] AI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine.[162][164][165][166] Generative AI Vincent van Gogh in watercolour created by generative AI softwareThese paragraphs are an excerpt from Generative artificial intelligence.[edit] Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI, GenAI,[167] or GAI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text, images, videos, or other forms of data.[168][169][170] These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data[171][172] based on the input, which often comes in the form of natural language prompts.[173][174] Generative AI tools have become more common since an "AI boom" in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs). Major tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Copilot, Gemini, and LLaMA; text-to-image artificial intelligence image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video AI generators such as Sora.[175][176][177][178] Technology companies developing generative AI include OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, DeepSeek, and Baidu.[179][180][181] Generative AI has raised many ethical questions. It can be used for cybercrime, or to deceive or manipulate people through fake news or deepfakes.[182] Even if used ethically, it may lead to the mass replacement of human jobs.[183] The tools themselves have been criticized as violating intellectual property laws, since they are trained on and emulate copyrighted works of art.[184] Agents Artificial intelligent (AI) agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.[185][186][187] Sexuality Applications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer prediction,[188] AI-integrated sex toys (e.g., teledildonics),[189] AI-generated sexual education content,[190] and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g., Replika).[191] AI is also used for the production of non-consensual deepfake pornography, raising significant ethical and legal concerns.[192] AI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online gender-based violence and online sexual grooming of minors.[193][194] Other industry-specific tasks There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated "AI" in some offerings or processes.[195] A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management. AI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate if and how people evacuated in large scale and small scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Further, AI can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions.[196][197][198] In agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for "classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights." For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation. During the 2024 Indian elections, US$50 million was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages.[199] Ethics Main article: Ethics of artificial intelligence AI has potential benefits and potential risks.[200] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to "solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else".[201] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified.[202] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.[203] Risks and harm Privacy and copyright Further information: Information privacy and Artificial intelligence and copyright Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright. AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency. Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio.[204] For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them.[205] Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.[206] AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy.[207] Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness. Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted "from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'."[208] Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of "fair use". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include "the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work" and "the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work".[209][210] Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a "robots.txt" file.[211] In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI.[212][213] Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.[214] Dominance by tech giants The commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, and Microsoft.[215][216][217] Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers, allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace.[218][219] Power needs and environmental impacts See also: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence In January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026, forecasting electric power use.[220] This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation.[221] Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources   from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that   in the long view   AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and "intelligent", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.[222] A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge, found "US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation...." and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.[223] Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.[224] In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for $650 Million (US).[225] Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers.[226] In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power   enough for 800,000 homes   of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at $1.6 billion (US) and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act.[227] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost $2 billion (US) to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon spinoff of Constellation.[228] After the last approval in September 2023, Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages.[229] Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025.[229] On the other hand, Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban.[229] Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI.[230] Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI.[230] On 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center.[231] According to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips, it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors.[231] In 2025 a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300-500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5% of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects (for example if people will pass from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it.[232] Misinformation See also: YouTube   Moderation and offensive content YouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation.[233] This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government.[234] The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem.[235] In 2022, generative AI began to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, films, or human writing. It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda.[236] One such potential malicious use is deepfakes for computational propaganda.[237] AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling "authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates" on a large scale, among other risks.[238] AI researchers at Microsoft, OpenAI, universities and other organisations have suggested using "personhood credentials" as a way to overcome online deception enabled by AI models.[239] Algorithmic bias and fairness Main articles: Algorithmic bias and Fairness (machine learning) Machine learning applications will be biased[k] if they learn from biased data.[241] The developers may not be aware that the bias exists.[242] Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed.[243][241] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination.[244] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases. On June 28, 2015, Google Photos's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as "gorillas" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,[245] a problem called "sample size disparity".[246] Google "fixed" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a "gorilla". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.[247] COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.[248] In 2017, several researchers[l] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.[250] A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as "race" or "gender"). The feature will correlate with other features (like "address", "shopping history" or "first name"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on "race" or "gender".[251] Moritz Hardt said "the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work."[252] Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make "predictions" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these "recommendations" will likely be racist.[253] Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.[m] Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.[246] There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is distributive fairness, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws.[240] At its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.[dubious   discuss][255] Lack of transparency See also: Explainable AI, Algorithmic transparency, and Right to explanation Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.[256] Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are a large amount of non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.[257] It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as "cancerous", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.[258] Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at "low risk" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.[259] People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation.[260] Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.[n] Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.[261] DARPA established the XAI ("Explainable Artificial Intelligence") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.[262] Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output.[263] LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model.[264] Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.[265] Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.[266] For generative pre-trained transformers, Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts.[267] Bad actors and weaponized AI Main articles: Lethal autonomous weapon, Artificial intelligence arms race, and AI safety Artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states. A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision.[o] Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction.[269] Even when used in conventional warfare, they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person.[269] In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed.[270] By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.[271] AI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware.[272] All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China.[273][274] There many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.[275] Technological unemployment Main articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.[276] In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that "we're in uncharted territory" with AI.[277] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed.[278] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at "high risk" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as "high risk".[p][280] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.[276] In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.[281][282] Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that "the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution" is "worth taking seriously".[283] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[284] From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.[285] Existential risk Main article: Existential risk from artificial intelligence It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, "spell the end of the human race".[286] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like "self-awareness" (or "sentience" or "consciousness") and becomes a malevolent character.[q] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. First, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip factory manager).[288] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that "you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead."[289] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is "fundamentally on our side".[290] Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are built on language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.[291] The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI.[292] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk,[293] as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, Demis Hassabis, and Sam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI. In May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to "freely speak out about the risks of AI" without "considering how this impacts Google".[294] He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover,[295] and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI.[296] In 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war".[297] Some other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer J rgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making "human lives longer and healthier and easier."[298] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, "they can also be used against the bad actors."[299][300] Andrew Ng also argued that "it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests."[301] Yann LeCun "scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction."[302] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.[303] However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.[304] Ethical machines and alignment Main articles: Machine ethics, AI safety, Friendly artificial intelligence, Artificial moral agents, and Human Compatible Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.[305] Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.[306] The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,[306] and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.[307] Other approaches include Wendell Wallach's "artificial moral agents"[308] and Stuart J. Russell's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.[309] Open source Active organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face,[310] Google,[311] EleutherAI and Meta.[312] Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, have been made open-weight,[313][314] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the "weights") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case.[315] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.[316] Frameworks Artificial Intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows:[317][318] Respect the dignity of individual people Connect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively Care for the wellbeing of everyone Protect social values, justice, and the public interest Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others;[319] however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regards to the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks.[320] Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.[321] The UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under a MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities.[322] Regulation Main articles: Regulation of artificial intelligence, Regulation of algorithms, and AI safety The first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation. The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.[323] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.[324] According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone.[325][326] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.[327] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.[327] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.[327] Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.[328] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years.[329] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics.[330] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the "Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories.[331] In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that "products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks".[325] A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity.[332] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it "very important", and an additional 41% thought it "somewhat important", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding "not very important" and 8% responding "not at all important".[333][334] In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.[335] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence.[336][337] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI.[338][339] History Main article: History of artificial intelligence For a chronological guide, see Timeline of artificial intelligence. In 2024, AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide.[340] Though China had more AI patents, the US had 35% more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China.[340] The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning.[341][342] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an "electronic brain".[r] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI,[344] such as McCullouch and Pitts design for "artificial neurons" in 1943,[115] and Turing's influential 1950 paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced the Turing test and showed that "machine intelligence" was plausible.[345][342] The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.[s][6] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.[t] They and their students produced programs that the press described as "astonishing":[u] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.[v][7] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.[342] Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field.[349] In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do".[350] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that "within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved".[351] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.[w] In 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[353] and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects.[354] Minsky's and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.[355] The "AI winter", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.[9] In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[356] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[8] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[10] Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition,[357] and began to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches.[358] Rodney Brooks rejected "representation" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.[x] Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh, and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic.[86][363] But the most important development was the revival of "connectionism", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others.[364] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.[365] AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This "narrow" and "formal" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics).[366] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as "artificial intelligence" (a tendency known as the AI effect).[367] However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or "AGI"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.[4] Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.[11] For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.[y] Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers,[369] graphics processing units, cloud computing[370]) and access to large amounts of data[371] (including curated datasets,[370] such as ImageNet). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.[z] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015 2019.[327] The number of Google searches for the term "AI" accelerated in 2022. In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.[304] In the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program taught only the game's rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text.[372] ChatGPT, launched on November 30, 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months.[373] It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness.[374] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about $50 billion annually was invested in "AI" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in "AI".[375] About 800,000 "AI"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022.[376] According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies.[377] Philosophy Main article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines.[378] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications.[379] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will.[380] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI.[379] Defining artificial intelligence See also: Turing test, Intelligent agent, Dartmouth workshop, and Synthetic intelligence Alan Turing wrote in 1950 "I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?"[381] He advised changing the question from whether a machine "thinks", to "whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour".[381] He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.[345] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is "actually" thinking or literally has a "mind". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but "it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks."[382] The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior.[383] Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure.[1] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. "Aeronautical engineering texts", they wrote, "do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.'"[384] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that "Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence".[385] McCarthy defines intelligence as "the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world".[386] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky, similarly describes it as "the ability to solve hard problems".[387] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the "intelligence" of the machine and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible. Another definition has been adopted by Google,[388] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. Some authors have suggested in practice, that the definition of AI is vague and difficult to define, with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as AI,[389] with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword, often even if they did "not actually use AI in a material way".[390] Evaluating approaches to AI No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history.[aa] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term "artificial intelligence" to mean "machine learning with neural networks"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers. Symbolic AI and its limits Symbolic AI (or "GOFAI")[392] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at "intelligent" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: "A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action."[393] However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level "intelligent" tasks were easy for AI, but low level "instinctive" tasks were extremely difficult.[394] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a "feel" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.[395] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.[ab][16] The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,[397][398] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. Neat vs. scruffy Main article: Neats and scruffies "Neats" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). "Scruffies" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,[399] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both. Soft vs. hard computing Main article: Soft computing Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems.[15] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. Narrow vs. general AI Main articles: Weak artificial intelligence and Artificial general intelligence AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals.[400][401] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively. Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind Main articles: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness The philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that "[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on."[402] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction. Consciousness Main articles: Hard problem of consciousness and Theory of mind David Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the "hard" and "easy" problems of consciousness.[403] The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.[404] Computationalism and functionalism Main articles: Computational theory of mind and Functionalism (philosophy of mind) Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.[405] Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as "strong AI": "The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds."[ac] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind.[409] AI welfare and rights It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree.[410] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals.[411][412] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights.[411] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.[413] In 2017, the European Union considered granting "electronic personhood" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.[414] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own.[415][416] Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.[412][411] Future Superintelligence and the singularity A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.[401] If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an "intelligence explosion" and Vernor Vinge called a "singularity".[417] However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.[418] Transhumanism Main article: Transhumanism Robot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.[419] Edward Fredkin argues that "artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's "Darwin among the Machines" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence.[420] Decomputing Arguments for decomputing have been raised by Dan McQuillan (Resisting AI: An Anti-fascist Approach to Artificial Intelligence, 2022), meaning an opposition to the sweeping application and expansion of artificial intelligence. Similar to degrowth, the approach criticizes AI as an outgrowth of the systemic issues and capitalist world we live in. It argues that a different future is possible, in which distance between people is reduced rather than increased through AI intermediaries.[421] In fiction Main article: Artificial intelligence in fiction The word "robot" itself was coined by Karel  apek in his 1921 play R.U.R., the title standing for "Rossum's Universal Robots". Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,[422] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.[423] A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.[424] Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the "Multivac" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;[425] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.[426] Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel  apek's R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.[427] See also Artificial consciousness   Field in cognitive science Artificial intelligence and elections   Use and impact of AI on political elections Artificial intelligence content detection   Software to detect AI-generated content Behavior selection algorithm   Algorithm that selects actions for intelligent agents Business process automation   Automation of business processes Case-based reasoning   Process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems Computational intelligence   Ability of a computer to learn a specific task from data or experimental observation Digital immortality   Hypothetical concept of storing a personality in digital form Emergent algorithm   Algorithm exhibiting emergent behavior Female gendering of AI technologies   Gender biases in digital technologyPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets Glossary of artificial intelligence   List of definitions of terms and concepts commonly used in the study of artificial intelligence Intelligence amplification   Use of information technology to augment human intelligence Intelligent agent   Software agent which acts autonomously Intelligent automation   Software process that combines robotic process automation and artificial intelligence Mind uploading   Hypothetical process of digitally emulating a brain Organoid intelligence   Use of brain cells and brain organoids for intelligent computing Robotic process automation   Form of business process automation technology The Last Day   1967 Welsh science fiction novel Wetware computer   Computer composed of organic material Explanatory notes ^ a b This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: Russell & Norvig (2021), Luger & Stubblefield (2004), Poole, Mackworth & Goebel (1998) and Nilsson (1998) ^ a b This list of tools is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: Russell & Norvig (2021), Luger & Stubblefield (2004), Poole, Mackworth & Goebel (1998) and Nilsson (1998) ^ It is among the reasons that expert systems proved to be inefficient for capturing knowledge.[30][31] ^ "Rational agent" is general term used in economics, philosophy and theoretical artificial intelligence. It can refer to anything that directs its behavior to accomplish goals, such as a person, an animal, a corporation, a nation, or in the case of AI, a computer program. ^ Alan Turing discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence".[42] In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, Ray Solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: "An Inductive Inference Machine".[43] ^ See AI winter   Machine translation and the ALPAC report of 1966 ^ Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For inference to be tractable, most observations must be conditionally independent of one another. AdSense uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve.[93] ^ Expectation maximization, one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, allows clustering in the presence of unknown latent variables.[95] ^ Some form of deep neural networks (without a specific learning algorithm) were described by: Warren S. McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943)[115] Alan Turing (1948);[116] Karl Steinbuch and Roger David Joseph (1961).[117] Deep or recurrent networks that learned (or used gradient descent) were developed by: Frank Rosenblatt(1957);[116] Oliver Selfridge (1959);[117] Alexey Ivakhnenko and Valentin Lapa (1965);[118] Kaoru Nakano (1971);[119] Shun-Ichi Amari (1972);[119] John Joseph Hopfield (1982).[119] Precursors to backpropagation were developed by: Henry J.

[And] our computers were millions of times too slow."[121] ^ In statistics, a bias is a systematic error or deviation from the correct value. But in the context of fairness, it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual characteristic, usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful. A statistically unbiased AI system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may thus be viewed as biased in the ethical sense.[240] ^ Including Jon Kleinberg (Cornell University), Sendhil Mullainathan (University of Chicago), Cynthia Chouldechova (Carnegie Mellon) and Sam Corbett-Davis (Stanford)[249] ^ Moritz Hardt (a director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems) argues that machine learning "is fundamentally the wrong tool for a lot of domains, where you're trying to design interventions and mechanisms that change the world."[254] ^ When the law was passed in 2018, it still contained a form of this provision. ^ This is the United Nations' definition, and includes things like land mines as well.[268] ^ See table 4; 9% is both the OECD average and the U.S. average.[279] ^ Sometimes called a "robopocalypse"[287] ^ "Electronic brain" was the term used by the press around this time.[341][343] ^ Daniel Crevier wrote, "the conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science."[346] Russell and Norvig called the conference "the inception of artificial intelligence."[115] ^ Russell and Norvig wrote "for the next 20 years the field would be dominated by these people and their students."[347] ^ Russell and Norvig wrote, "it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish".[348] ^ The programs described are Arthur Samuel's checkers program for the IBM 701, Daniel Bobrow's STUDENT, Newell and Simon's Logic Theorist and Terry Winograd's SHRDLU. ^ Russell and Norvig write: "in almost all cases, these early systems failed on more difficult problems"[352] ^ Embodied approaches to AI[359] were championed by Hans Moravec[360] and Rodney Brooks[361] and went by many names: Nouvelle AI.[361] Developmental robotics.[362] ^ Matteo Wong wrote in The Atlantic: "Whereas for decades, computer-science fields such as natural-language processing, computer vision, and robotics used extremely different methods, now they all use a programming method called "deep learning". As a result, their code and approaches have become more similar, and their models are easier to integrate into one another."[368] ^ Jack Clark wrote in Bloomberg: "After a half-decade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, 2015 has been a landmark year. Computers are smarter and learning faster than ever", and noted that the number of software projects that use machine learning at Google increased from a "sporadic usage" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects in 2015.[370] ^ Nils Nilsson wrote in 1983: "Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about."[391] ^ Daniel Crevier wrote that "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier."[396] ^ Searle presented this definition of "Strong AI" in 1999.[406] Searle's original formulation was "The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states."[407] Strong AI is defined similarly by Russell and Norvig: "Stong AI   the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking)."[408] References ^ a b c Russell & Norvig (2021), pp. 1 4. ^ AI set to exceed human brain power Archived 2008-02-19 at the Wayback Machine CNN.com (July 26, 2006) ^ Kaplan, Andreas; Haenlein, Michael (2019).

In a manner analogous to electricity or computers, AI serves as a general-purpose technology. AI programs are designed to simulate human perception and understanding. These systems are capable of adapting to new information and responding to changing situations. Machine learning has been used for various scientific and commercial purposes[1] including language translation, image recognition, decision-making,[2][3] credit scoring, and e-commerce. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is all about creating computer systems that act like people. This means they can understand information and human language and make decisions similar to how we do. Artificial intelligence technologies are now being used across various industries, transforming how they function and creating new opportunities. This article provides an overview of the applications of AI in fields like health care, finance, and education, while also discussing the challenges and future prospects in these areas. Internet and e-commerce[edit] Main article: Marketing and artificial intelligence Web feeds and posts[edit] Machine learning has been used for recommendation systems in determining which posts should show up in social media feeds.[4][5] Various types of social media analysis also make use of machine learning[6][7] and there is research into its use for (semi-)automated tagging/enhancement/correction of online misinformation and related filter bubbles.[8][9][10] AI has been used to customize shopping options and personalize offers.[11] Online gambling companies have used AI for targeting gamblers.[12] Virtual assistants and search[edit] Main article: Virtual assistant Intelligent personal assistants use AI to understand many natural language requests in other ways than rudimentary commands. Common examples are Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and a more recent AI, ChatGPT by OpenAI.[13] Bing Chat has used artificial intelligence as part of its search engine.[14] Spam filtering[edit] Main article: Spam filter Machine learning can be used to combat spam, scams, and phishing. It can scrutinize the contents of spam and phishing attacks to attempt to identify malicious elements.[15] Some models built via machine learning algorithms have over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails.[16] These models can be refined using new data and evolving spam tactics. Machine learning also analyzes traits such as sender behavior, email header information, and attachment types, potentially enhancing spam detection.[17] Language translation[edit] Main article: Machine translation Speech translation technology attempts to convert one language's spoken words into another language. This potentially reduces language barriers in global commerce and cross-cultural exchange, enabling speakers of various languages to communicate with one another.[18] AI has been used to automatically translate spoken language and textual content in products such as Microsoft Translator, Google Translate, and DeepL Translator.[19] Additionally, research and development are in progress to decode and conduct animal communication.[20][21] Meaning is conveyed not only by text, but also through usage and context (see semantics and pragmatics). As a result, the two primary categorization approaches for machine translations are statistical machine translation (SMT) and neural machine translations (NMTs). The old method of performing translation was to use statistical methodology to forecast the best probable output with specific algorithms. However, with NMT, the approach employs dynamic algorithms to achieve better translations based on context.[22] Facial recognition and image labeling[edit] Main article: Automatic image annotation AI has been used in facial recognition systems. Some examples are Apple's Face ID and Android's Face Unlock, which are used to secure mobile devices.[23] Image labeling has been used by Google Image Labeler to detect products in photos and to allow people to search based on a photo. Image labeling has also been demonstrated to generate speech to describe images to blind people.[19] Facebook's DeepFace identifies human faces in digital images.[citation needed] Social media sites and content aggregators use AI systems to make personalized news feeds by watching users' actions and engagement history.[24] Content moderation often relies on AI to spot harmful content, though these systems have trouble with understanding the bigger picture. Search engines use rules to rank results and understand what people want, while virtual helpers like Siri and Alexa use everyday language to read user queries. Email services use learning tools to find spam by checking the content and patterns.[25] Neural machine translation systems have gotten much better at translating text. It works by examining complete sentences to maintain accuracy. Computer vision systems can identify people in images and videos. This assists with tasks like sorting photos and performing security checks. AI is often used for surveillance for credit systems, targeted advertising and automation we can erode privacy and concentrate power. It also led to dystopian outcomes such as autonomous systems making unaccountable decisions.[26] Games and entertainment[edit] See also: Video game bot and Artificial intelligence in video games Games have been a major application[relevant?] of AI's capabilities since the 1950s. In the 21st century, AIs have beaten human players in many games, including chess (Deep Blue), Jeopardy! (Watson),[27] Go (AlphaGo),[28][29][30][31][32][33][34] poker (Pluribus[35] and Cepheus),[36] E-sports (StarCraft),[37][38] and general game playing (AlphaZero[39][40][41] and MuZero).[42][43][44][45] Kuki AI is a set of chatbots and other apps which were designed for entertainment and as a marketing tool.[46][47] Character.ai is another example of a chatbot being used for recreation.[citation needed] AI has changed gaming by making smart non-player characters (NPCs) that can adjust.[48] Algorithms can now create game worlds and situations on their own, which reduces development costs and revives the excitement to play again. In digital art and music, AI tools help people express themselves in fresh, new ways using generative algorithms.[49] Recommendation systems on streaming platforms check how people watch to suggest content. This greatly affects the way viewers enjoy the media.[citation needed] Economic and social challenges[edit] AI for Good is a platform launched in 2017 by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) agency of the United Nations (UN). The goal of the platform is to use AI to help achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.[citation needed] The University of Southern California launched the Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society, with the goal of using AI to address problems such as homelessness. Stanford researchers use AI to analyze satellite images to identify high poverty areas.[50] Agriculture[edit] See also: Precision agriculture and Digital agriculture In agriculture, AI has been proposed as a way for farmers to identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, or pesticide treatments to increase yields, thereby improving efficiency.[51] AI has been used to attempt to classify livestock pig call emotions,[20] automate greenhouses,[52] detect diseases and pests,[53] and optimize irrigation.[54] Precision farming uses machine learning and data from satellites, drones and sensors to water, fertilize and manage pests. Computer vision helps keep an eye on plant health, spot diseases and even help with automated harvesting of specific crops. With predictive analytics farmers can make better decisions by predicting weather patterns and knowing when to plant.[55] AI helps with livestock management by tracking animal health and production. These are the tools of "smart farming". They make farming better and more sustainable.[citation needed] Cyber security[edit] Cyber security companies are adopting neural networks, machine learning, and natural language processing to improve their systems.[56] Applications of AI in cyber security include: Network protection: Machine learning improves intrusion detection systems by broadening the search beyond previously identified threats.[57] Endpoint protection: Attacks such as ransomware can be thwarted by learning typical malware behaviors. AI-related cyber security application cases vary in both benefit and complexity. Security features such as Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) and Extended Endpoint Detection and Response (XDR) offer significant benefits for businesses, but require significant integration and adaptation efforts.[58] Application security: can help counterattacks such as server-side request forgery, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and distributed denial-of-service. AI technology can also be utilized to improve system security and safeguard our privacy. Randrianasolo (2012) suggested a security system based on artificial intelligence that can recognize intrusions and adapt to perform better.[59] In order to improve cloud computing security, Sahil (2015) created a user profile system for the cloud environment with AI techniques.[60] Suspect user behavior: Machine learning can identify fraud or compromised applications as they occur.[61] Machine learning tools look at traffic patterns. They find an unusual activity that might be a security breach. Automated systems gather and analyze data. Their goal is to find new threats before they do significant damage.[62] User behavior analytics establish normal patterns for users and systems that alert when there is a change that might mean a hacked account.[citation needed] AI brings new challenges to cybersecurity. Attackers are using the same tools to plan smarter attacks. This is an ongoing race to technological arms race.[citation needed] Education[edit] See also: AI in education AI elevates teaching, focusing on significant issues like the knowledge nexus and educational equality. The evolution of AI in education and technology should be used to improve human capabilities in relationships where they do not replace humans. UNESCO recognizes the future of AI in education as an instrument to reach Sustainable Development Goal 4, called "Inclusive and Equitable Quality Education." [63] The World Economic Forum also stresses AI's contribution to students' overall improvement and transforming teaching into a more enjoyable process.[63] Personalized Learning[edit] AI driven tutoring systems, such as Khan Academy, Duolingo and Carnegie Learning are the forefoot of delivering personalized education.[64] These platforms leverage AI algorithms to analyze individual learning patterns, strengths, and weaknesses, enabling the customization of content and Algorithm to suit each student's pace and style of learning.[64] Administrative Efficiency[edit] In educational institutions, AI is increasingly used to automate routine tasks like attendance tracking, grading and marking, which allows educators to devote more time to interactive teaching and direct student engagement.[65] Furthermore, AI tools are employed to monitor student progress, analyze learning behaviors, and predict academic challenges, facilitating timely and proactive interventions for students who may be at risk of falling behind.[65] Ethical and Privacy Concerns[edit] Despite the benefits, the integration of AI in education raises significant ethical and privacy concerns, particularly regarding the handling of sensitive student data.[64] It is imperative that AI systems in education are designed and operated with a strong emphasis on transparency, security, and respect for privacy to maintain trust and uphold the integrity of educational practices.[64] Much of the regulation will be influenced by the AI Act, the world's first comprehensive AI law.[66] Intelligent tutoring systems provide personalized learning by adapting content based on how each student performs. Automated assessment tools check student work and give fast feedback which reduces the tutor workload.[67] Learning analytics platforms can find students who might have trouble sooner. They do this by looking for patterns connected to learning issues.[citation needed] Content creation tools assist teachers in making learning materials that fit each student's needs. This includes turning text into several languages. Even though these tools offer many benefits, there are still concerns about data privacy. People worry it could also widen the current gaps in education.[68] Finance[edit] Financial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm, flagging these for human investigation. The use of AI in banking began in 1987 when Security Pacific National Bank launched a fraud prevention task-force to counter the unauthorized use of debit cards.[69] Banks use AI to organize operations for bookkeeping, investing in stocks, and managing properties. AI can adapt to changes during non-business hours.[70] AI is used to combat fraud and financial crimes by monitoring behavioral patterns for any abnormal changes or anomalies.[71][72][73] The use of AI in applications such as online trading and decision-making has changed major economic theories.[74] For example, AI-based buying and selling platforms estimate personalized demand and supply curves, thus enabling individualized pricing. AI systems reduce information asymmetry in the market and thus make markets more efficient.[75] The application of artificial intelligence in the financial industry can alleviate the financing constraints of non-state-owned enterprises, especially for smaller and more innovative enterprises.[76] Algorithmic trading systems make trades much quicker and in larger amounts than human traders. Robo-advisors provide automatic advice for investing and managing your money at a lower cost than human advisors. Insurance and lending companies use machine learning to determine risks and set prices.[citation needed] Financial groups use AI systems to check transactions for money laundering. They do this by spotting strange patterns.[77] Auditing gets better with detection algorithms. These algorithms find unusual financial transactions.[citation needed] Trading and investment[edit] Algorithmic trading involves using AI systems to make trading decisions at speeds of magnitude greater than any human is capable of, making millions of trades in a day without human intervention. Such high-frequency trading represents a fast-growing sector. Many banks, funds, and proprietary trading firms now have AI-managed portfolios. Automated trading systems are typically used by large institutional investors but include smaller firms trading with their own AI systems.[78] Large financial institutions use AI to assist with their investment practices. BlackRock's AI engine, Aladdin, is used both within the company and by clients to help with investment decisions. Its functions include the use of natural language processing to analyze text such as news, broker reports, and social media feeds. It then gauges the sentiment on the companies mentioned and assigns a score. Banks such as UBS and Deutsche Bank use SQREEM (Sequential Quantum Reduction and Extraction Model) to mine data to develop consumer profiles and match them with wealth management products.[79] Underwriting[edit] Online lender Upstart uses machine learning for underwriting.[80] ZestFinance's Zest Automated Machine Learning (ZAML) platform is used for credit underwriting. This platform uses machine learning to analyze data, including purchase transactions and how a customer fills out a form, to score borrowers. The platform is handy for assigning credit scores to those with limited credit histories.[81] Audit[edit] AI makes continuous auditing possible. Potential benefits include reducing audit risk, increasing the level of assurance, and reducing audit duration.[82][quantify] Continuous auditing with AI allows real-time monitoring and reporting of financial activities and provides businesses with timely insights that can lead to quick decision-making.[83] Anti-money laundering[edit] AI software, such as LaundroGraph which uses contemporary suboptimal datasets, could be used for anti-money laundering (AML).[84][85] History[edit] In the 1980s, AI started to become prominent in finance as expert systems were commercialized. For example, Dupont created 100 expert systems, which helped them to save almost $10 million per year.[86] One of the first systems was the Pro-trader expert system that predicted the 87-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1986. "The major junctions of the system were to monitor premiums in the market, determine the optimum investment strategy, execute transactions when appropriate and modify the knowledge base through a learning mechanism."[87] One of the first expert systems to help with financial plans was PlanPowerm and Client Profiling System, created by Applied Expert Systems (APEX). It was launched in 1986. It helped create personal financial plans for people.[88] In the 1990s, AI was applied to fraud detection. In 1993, FinCEN Artificial Intelligence System (FAIS) was launched. It was able to review over 200,000 transactions per week, and over two years, it helped identify 400 potential cases of money laundering equal to $1 billion.[89] These expert systems were later replaced by machine learning systems.[90] AI can enhance entrepreneurial activity, and AI is one of the most dynamic areas for start-ups, with significant venture capital flowing into AI.[91] Government[edit] Main article: Artificial intelligence in government AI facial recognition systems are used for mass surveillance, notably in China.[92][93] In 2019, Bengaluru, India deployed AI-managed traffic signals. This system uses cameras to monitor traffic density and adjust signal timing based on the interval needed to clear traffic.[94] Military[edit] Main article: Military applications of artificial intelligence Various countries are deploying AI military applications.[95] The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability.[citation needed] Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles.[95] AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams.[citation needed] AI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine.[95][96][97][98] Health[edit] Healthcare[edit] Main article: Artificial intelligence in healthcare X-ray of a hand, with automatic calculation of bone age by a computer software A patient-side surgical arm of Da Vinci Surgical System AI in healthcare is often used for classification, to evaluate a CT scan or electrocardiogram or to identify high-risk patients for population health. AI is helping with the high-cost problem of dosing. One study suggested that AI could save $16 billion. In 2016, a study reported that an AI-derived formula derived the proper dose of immunosuppressant drugs to give to transplant patients.[99] Current research has indicated that non-cardiac vascular illnesses are also being treated with artificial intelligence (AI). For certain disorders, AI algorithms can aid in diagnosis, recommended treatments, outcome prediction, and patient progress tracking. As AI technology advances, it is anticipated that it will become more significant in the healthcare industry.[100] The early detection of diseases like cancer is made possible by AI algorithms, which diagnose diseases by analyzing complex sets of medical data. For example, the IBM Watson system might be used to comb through massive data such as medical records and clinical trials to help diagnose a problem.[101] Microsoft's AI project Hanover helps doctors choose cancer treatments from among the more than 800 medicines and vaccines.[102][103] Its goal is to memorize all the relevant papers to predict which (combinations of) drugs will be most effective for each patient. Myeloid leukemia is one target. Another study reported on an AI that was as good as doctors in identifying skin cancers.[104] Another project monitors multiple high-risk patients by asking each patient questions based on data acquired from doctor/patient interactions.[105] In one study done with transfer learning, an AI diagnosed eye conditions similar to an ophthalmologist and recommended treatment referrals.[106] Another study demonstrated surgery with an autonomous robot. The team supervised the robot while it performed soft-tissue surgery, stitching together a pig's bowel judged better than a surgeon.[107] Artificial neural networks are used as clinical decision support systems for medical diagnosis,[108] such as in concept processing technology in EMR software. Other healthcare tasks thought suitable for an AI that are in development include: Screening[109] Heart sound analysis[110] Companion robots for elder care[111] Medical record analysis Treatment plan design[citation needed] Medication management Assisting blind people[112] Consultations[citation needed] Drug creation[113] (e.g. by identifying candidate drugs[114] and by using existing drug screening data such as in life extension research)[115] Clinical training[116] Outcome prediction for surgical procedures HIV prognosis Identifying genomic pathogen signatures of novel pathogens[117] or identifying pathogens via physics-based fingerprints[118] (including pandemic pathogens) Helping link genes to their functions,[119] otherwise analyzing genes[120] and identification of novel biological targets[121] Help development of biomarkers[121] Help tailor therapies to individuals in personalized medicine/precision medicine[121][122][123] Workplace health and safety[edit] Main article: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence   Health and safety applications AI-enabled chatbots decrease the need for humans to perform basic call center tasks.[124] Machine learning in sentiment analysis can spot fatigue in order to prevent overwork.[124] Similarly, decision support systems can prevent industrial disasters and make disaster response more efficient.[125] For manual workers in material handling, predictive analytics may be used to reduce musculoskeletal injury.[126] Data collected from wearable sensors can improve workplace health surveillance, risk assessment, and research.[125][how?] AI can auto-code workers' compensation claims.[127][128] AI-enabled virtual reality systems can enhance safety training for hazard recognition.[125] AI can more efficiently detect accident near misses, which are important in reducing accident rates, but are often underreported.[129] Biochemistry[edit] AlphaFold 2 can determine the 3D structure of a (folded) protein in hours rather than the months required by earlier automated approaches and was used to provide the likely structures of all proteins in the human body and essentially all proteins known to science (more than 200 million).[130][131][132][133] Medical imaging analysis systems can spot patterns that indicate diseases such as cancer. They can do this just as well as human experts. Predictive analytics can help identify patients with a higher risk for specific conditions. This helps in starting treatments earlier.[134] Natural language processing gets key information from electronic health records. This helps doctors make better choices. Machine learning helps find new drugs by predicting how molecules will work together. This can quicken the development of new treatments.[135] Personalized medicine uses AI to change treatments to match each patient's needs. Chemistry and biology[edit] See also: Regulation of chemicals, Computational chemistry   Fields of application, and Laboratory robotics Machine learning has been used for drug design.[136] It has also been used for predicting molecular properties and exploring large chemical/reaction spaces.[137] Computer-planned syntheses via computational reaction networks, described as a platform that combines "computational synthesis with AI algorithms to predict molecular properties",[138] have been used to explore the origins of life on Earth,[139] drug-syntheses and developing routes for recycling 200 industrial waste chemicals into important drugs and agrochemicals (chemical synthesis design).[140] There is research about which types of computer-aided chemistry would benefit from machine learning.[141] It can also be used for "drug discovery and development, drug repurposing, improving pharmaceutical productivity, and clinical trials".[142] It has been used for the design of proteins with prespecified functional sites.[143][144] It has been used with databases for the development of a 46-day process to design, synthesize and test a drug which inhibits enzymes of a particular gene, DDR1. DDR1 is involved in cancers and fibrosis which is one reason for the high-quality datasets that enabled these results.[145] There are various types of applications for machine learning in decoding human biology, such as helping to map gene expression patterns to functional activation patterns[146] or identifying functional DNA motifs.[147] It is widely used in genetic research.[148] There also is some use of machine learning in synthetic biology,[149][150] disease biology,[150] nanotechnology (e.g. nanostructured materials and bionanotechnology),[151][152] and materials science.[153][154][155] Novel types of machine learning[edit] See also: Artificial brain and Automated reasoning Schema of the process of a semi-automated robot scientist process that includes Web statement extraction and biological laboratory testing There are also prototype robot scientists, including robot-embodied ones like the two Robot Scientists, which show a form of "machine learning" not commonly associated with the term.[156][157] Similarly, there is research and development of biological "wetware computers" that can learn (e.g. for use as biosensors) and/or implantation into an organism's body (e.g. for use to control prosthetics).[158][159][160] Polymer-based artificial neurons operate directly in biological environments and define biohybrid neurons made of artificial and living components.[161][162] Moreover, if whole brain emulation is possible via both scanning and replicating, at a minimum, the bio-chemical brain   as premised in the form of digital replication in The Age of Em, possibly using physical neural networks   that may have applications as or more extensive than e.g. valued human activities and may imply that society would face substantial moral choices, societal risks and ethical problems[163][164] such as whether (and how) such are built, sent through space and used compared to potentially competing e.g. potentially more synthetic and/or less human and/or non/less-sentient types of artificial/semi-artificial intelligence.[additional citation(s) needed] An alternative or additive approach to scanning are types of reverse engineering of the brain.[165][166] A subcategory of artificial intelligence is embodied,[167][168] some of which are mobile robotic systems that each consist of one or multiple robots that are able to learn in the physical world. Digital ghosts[edit] Main article: Resurrection   Digital ghosts Biological computing in AI and as AI[edit] Additionally, biological computers, even if both artificial and highly intelligent, are typically distinguishable from synthetic, predominantly silicon-based, computers. The two technologies could, however, be combined and used for the design of either. Moreover, many tasks may be poorly carried out by AI even if it uses algorithms that are transparent, understood, bias-free, apparently effective and goal-aligned in addition to having trained data sets that are sufficiently large and cleansed. This may occur, for instance, when the underlying data, available metrics, values or training methods are incorrect, flawed or used inappropriately. Computer-aided is a phrase used to describe human activities that make use of computing as tool in more comprehensive activities and systems such as AI for narrow tasks or making use of such without substantially relying on its results (see also: human-in-the-loop).[citation needed] One study described the biological component as a limitation of AI stating that "as long as the biological system cannot be understood, formalized, and imitated, we will not be able to develop technologies that can mimic it" and that, even if it were understood, this does not necessarily mean there will be "a technological solution to imitate natural intelligence".[169] Technologies that integrate biology and AI include biorobotics. Astronomy, space activities and ufology[edit] Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data[170][171] and applications, mainly for "classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights" for example for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy.[172] It could also be used for activities in space such as space exploration, including analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance,[173] and more autonomous operation.[174][175][176][171] In the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), machine learning has been used in attempts to identify artificially generated electromagnetic waves in available data[177][178]   such as real-time observations[179]   and other technosignatures, e.g. via anomaly detection.[180] In ufology, the SkyCAM-5 project headed by Prof. Hakan Kayal[181] and the Galileo Project headed by Avi Loeb use machine learning to attempt to detect and classify types of UFOs.[182][183][184][185][186] The Galileo Project also seeks to detect two further types of potential extraterrestrial technological signatures with the use of AI: 'Oumuamua-like interstellar objects, and non-manmade artificial satellites.[187][188] Machine learning can also be used to produce datasets of spectral signatures of molecules that may be involved in the atmospheric production or consumption of particular chemicals   such as phosphine possibly detected on Venus   which could prevent miss assignments and, if accuracy is improved, be used in future detections and identifications of molecules on other planets.[189] Other fields of research[edit] Evidence of general impacts[edit] In April 2024, the Scientific Advice Mechanism to the European Commission published advice[190] including a comprehensive evidence review of the opportunities and challenges posed by artificial intelligence in scientific research. As benefits, the evidence review[191] highlighted: its role in accelerating research and innovation its capacity to automate workflows enhancing dissemination of scientific work As challenges: limitations and risks around transparency, reproducibility and interpretability poor performance (inaccuracy) risk of harm through misuse or unintended use societal concerns including the spread of misinformation and increasing inequalities Archaeology, history and imaging of sites[edit] See also: Digital archaeology Machine learning can help to restore and attribute ancient texts.[192] It can help to index texts for example to enable better and easier searching and classification of fragments.[193] Artificial intelligence can also be used to investigate genomes to uncover genetic history, such as interbreeding between archaic and modern humans by which for example the past existence of a ghost population, not Neanderthal or Denisovan, was inferred.[194] Further information: Ancient DNA   Human aDNA, and Genetic history of Europe It can also be used for "non-invasive and non-destructive access to internal structures of archaeological remains".[195] Further information: Remote sensing in archaeology Physics[edit] Main article: Machine learning in physics A deep learning system was reported to learn intuitive physics from visual data (of virtual 3D environments) based on an unpublished approach inspired by studies of visual cognition in infants.[196][197] Other researchers have developed a machine learning algorithm that could discover sets of basic variables of various physical systems and predict the systems' future dynamics from video recordings of their behavior.[198][199] In the future, it may be possible that such can be used to automate the discovery of physical laws of complex systems.[198] Materials science[edit] AI could be used for materials optimization and discovery such as the discovery of stable materials and the prediction of their crystal structure.[200][201][202] In November 2023, researchers at Google DeepMind and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory announced that they had developed an AI system known as GNoME. This system has contributed to materials science by discovering over 2 million new materials within a relatively short timeframe. GNoME employs deep learning techniques to efficiently explore potential material structures, achieving a significant increase in the identification of stable inorganic crystal structures. The system's predictions were validated through autonomous robotic experiments, demonstrating a noteworthy success rate of 71%. The data of newly discovered materials is publicly available through the Materials Project database, offering researchers the opportunity to identify materials with desired properties for various applications. This development has implications for the future of scientific discovery and the integration of AI in material science research, potentially expediting material innovation and reducing costs in product development. The use of AI and deep learning suggests the possibility of minimizing or eliminating manual lab experiments and allowing scientists to focus more on the design and analysis of unique compounds.[203][204][205] Reverse engineering[edit] Machine learning is used in diverse types of reverse engineering. For example, machine learning has been used to reverse engineer a composite material part, enabling unauthorized production of high quality parts,[206] and for quickly understanding the behavior of malware.[207][208][209] It can be used to reverse engineer artificial intelligence models.[210] It can also design components by engaging in a type of reverse engineering of not-yet existent virtual components such as inverse molecular design for particular desired functionality[211] or protein design for prespecified functional sites.[143][144] Biological network reverse engineering could model interactions in a human understandable way, e.g. bas on time series data of gene expression levels.[212] Law[edit] Main article: Legal informatics   Artificial intelligence Legal analysis[edit] AI is a mainstay of law-related professions. Algorithms and machine learning do some tasks previously done by entry-level lawyers.[213] While its use is common, it is not expected to replace most work done by lawyers in the near future.[214] The electronic discovery industry uses machine learning to reduce manual searching.[215] Law enforcement and legal proceedings[edit] Law enforcement has begun using facial recognition systems (FRS) to identify suspects from visual data. FRS results have proven to be more accurate when compared to eyewitness results. Furthermore, FRS has shown to have much a better ability to identify individuals when video clarity and visibility are low in comparison to human participants.[216] COMPAS is a commercial system used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of recidivism.[217] One concern relates to algorithmic bias, AI programs may become biased after processing data that exhibits bias.[218] ProPublica claims that the average COMPAS-assigned recidivism risk level of black defendants is significantly higher than that of white defendants.[217] In 2019, the city of Hangzhou, China established a pilot program artificial intelligence-based Internet Court to adjudicate disputes related to ecommerce and internet-related intellectual property claims.[219]: 124 Parties appear before the court via videoconference and AI evaluates the evidence presented and applies relevant legal standards.[219]: 124 Services[edit] Human resources[edit] Main article: Artificial intelligence in hiring Another application of AI is in human resources. AI can screen resumes and rank candidates based on their qualifications, predict candidate success in given roles, and automate repetitive communication tasks via chatbots.[citation needed] Job search[edit] AI has simplified the recruiting/job search process for both recruiters and job seekers. According to Raj Mukherjee from Indeed, 65% of job searchers search again within 91 days after hire. An AI-powered engine streamlines the complexity of job hunting by assessing information on job skills, salaries, and user tendencies, matching job seekers to the most relevant positions. Machine intelligence calculates appropriate wages and highlights resume information for recruiters using NLP, which extracts relevant words and phrases from text. Another application is an AI resume builder that compiles a CV in 5 minutes.[citation needed] Chatbots assist website visitors and refine workflows. Online and telephone customer service[edit] An automated online assistant providing customer service on a web page AI underlies avatars (automated online assistants) on web pages.[220] It can reduce operation and training costs.[220] Pypestream automated customer service for its mobile application to streamline communication with customers.[221] A Google app analyzes language and converts speech into text. The platform can identify angry customers through their language and respond appropriately.[222] Amazon uses a chatbot for customer service that can perform tasks like checking the status of an order, cancelling orders, offering refunds and connecting the customer with a human representative.[223] Generative AI (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, is increasingly used in business to automate tasks and enhance decision-making.[224] Hospitality[edit] In the hospitality industry, AI is used to reduce repetitive tasks, analyze trends, interact with guests, and predict customer needs.[225] AI hotel services come in the form of a chatbot,[226] application, virtual voice assistant and service robots. Media[edit] See also: Synthetic media Image restoration AI applications analyze media content such as movies, TV programs, advertisement videos or user-generated content. The solutions often involve computer vision. Typical scenarios include the analysis of images using object recognition or face recognition techniques, or the analysis of video for scene recognizing scenes, objects or faces. AI-based media analysis can facilitate media search, the creation of descriptive keywords for content, content policy monitoring (such as verifying the suitability of content for a particular TV viewing time), speech to text for archival or other purposes, and the detection of logos, products or celebrity faces for ad placement. Motion interpolation[227] Pixel-art scaling algorithms[228] Image scaling[229] Image restoration[230][231] Photo colorization[232] Film restoration and video upscaling[233] Photo tagging[234] Automated species identification (such as identifying plants, fungi and animals with an app) Text-to-image models such as DALL-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion Image to video[235] Text to video such as Make-A-Video from Meta, Imagen video and Phenaki from Google Text to music with AI models such as MusicLM[236][237] Text to speech such as ElevenLabs and 15.ai Motion capture[238] Make image transparent[239] Deep-fakes[edit] Deep-fakes can be used for comedic purposes but are better known for fake news and hoaxes. Deepfakes can portray individuals in harmful or compromising situations, causing significant reputational damage and emotional distress, especially when the content is defamatory or violates personal ethics. While defamation and false light laws offer some recourse, their focus on false statements rather than fabricated images or videos often leaves victims with limited legal protection and a challenging burden of proof.[240] In January 2016,[241] the Horizon 2020 program financed the InVID Project[242][243] to help journalists and researchers detect fake documents, made available as browser plugins.[244][245] In June 2016, the visual computing group of the Technical University of Munich and from Stanford University developed Face2Face,[246] a program that animates photographs of faces, mimicking the facial expressions of another person. The technology has been demonstrated animating the faces of people including Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin. Other methods have been demonstrated based on deep neural networks, from which the name deep fake was taken. In September 2018, U.S. Senator Mark Warner proposed to penalize social media companies that allow sharing of deep-fake documents on their platforms.[247] In 2018, Darius Afchar and Vincent Nozick found a way to detect faked content by analyzing the mesoscopic properties of video frames.[248] DARPA gave 68 million dollars to work on deep-fake detection.[248] Audio deepfakes[249][250] and AI software capable of detecting deep-fakes and cloning human voices have been developed.[251][252] Respeecher is a program that enables one person to speak with the voice of another. Video surveillance analysis and manipulated media detection[edit] See also: Web scraping, Photograph manipulation, and Video manipulation This section is an excerpt from Video content analysis   Artificial Intelligence.[edit] Artificial intelligence for video surveillance utilizes computer software programs that analyze the audio and images from video surveillance cameras in order to recognize humans, vehicles, objects and events. Security contractors program is the software to define restricted areas within the camera's view (such as a fenced off area, a parking lot but not the sidewalk or public street outside the lot) and program for times of day (such as after the close of business) for the property being protected by the camera surveillance. The artificial intelligence ("A.I.") sends an alert if it detects a trespasser breaking the "rule" set that no person is allowed in that area during that time of day. AI algorithms have been used to detect deepfake videos.[253][254] Video production[edit] Artificial intelligence is also starting to be used in video production, with tools and software being developed that utilize generative AI in order to create new video, or alter existing video. Some of the major tools that are being used in these processes currently are DALL-E, Mid-journey, and Runway.[255] Way mark Studios utilized the tools offered by both DALL-E and Mid-journey to create a fully AI generated film called The Frost in the summer of 2023.[255] Way mark Studios is experimenting with using these AI tools to generate advertisements and commercials for companies in mere seconds.[255] Yves Bergquist, a director of the AI & Neuroscience in Media Project at USC's Entertainment Technology Center, says post production crews in Hollywood are already using generative AI, and predicts that in the future more companies will embrace this new technology.[256] Music[edit] Main article: Music and artificial intelligence AI has been used to compose music of various genres. David Cope created an AI called Emily Howell that managed to become well known in the field of algorithmic computer music.[257] The algorithm behind Emily Howell is registered as a US patent.[258] In 2012, AI Iamus created the first complete classical album.[259] AIVA (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Artist), composes symphonic music, mainly classical music for film scores.[260] It achieved a world first by becoming the first virtual composer to be recognized by a musical professional association.[261] Melomics creates computer-generated music for stress and pain relief.[262] At Sony CSL Research Laboratory, the Flow Machines software creates pop songs by learning music styles from a huge database of songs. It can compose in multiple styles. The Watson Beat uses reinforcement learning and deep belief networks to compose music on a simple seed input melody and a select style. The software was open sourced[263] and musicians such as Taryn Southern[264] collaborated with the project to create music. South Korean singer, Hayeon's, debut song, "Eyes on You" was composed using AI which was supervised by real composers, including NUVO.[265] Writing and reporting[edit] Narrative Science sells computer-generated news and reports. It summarizes sporting events based on statistical data from the game. It also creates financial reports and real estate analyses.[266] Automated Insights generates personalized recaps and previews for Yahoo Sports Fantasy Football.[267] Yseop, uses AI to turn structured data into natural language comments and recommendations. Yseop writes financial reports, executive summaries, personalized sales or marketing documents and more in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, and German.[268] TALESPIN made up stories similar to the fables of Aesop. The program started with a set of characters who wanted to achieve certain goals. The story narrated their attempts to satisfy these goals.[citation needed] Mark Riedl and Vadim Bulitko asserted that the essence of storytelling was experience management, or "how to balance the need for a coherent story progression with user agency, which is often at odds".[269] While AI storytelling focuses on story generation (character and plot), story communication also received attention. In 2002, researchers developed an architectural framework for narrative prose generation. They faithfully reproduced text variety and complexity on stories such as Little Red Riding Hood.[270] In 2016, a Japanese AI co-wrote a short story and almost won a literary prize.[271] South Korean company Hanteo Global uses a journalism bot to write articles.[272] Literary authors are also exploring uses of AI. An example is David Jhave Johnston's work ReRites (2017 2019), where the poet created a daily rite of editing the poetic output of a neural network to create a series of performances and publications. Sports writing[edit] In 2010, artificial intelligence used baseball statistics to automatically generate news articles. This was launched by The Big Ten Network using software from Narrative Science.[273] After being unable to cover every Minor League Baseball game with a large team, Associated Press collaborated with Automated Insights in 2016 to create game recaps that were automated by artificial intelligence.[274] UOL in Brazil expanded the use of AI in its writing. Rather than just generating news stories, they programmed the AI to include commonly searched words on Google.[274] El Pais, a Spanish news site that covers many things including sports, allows users to make comments on each news article. They use the Perspective API to moderate these comments and if the software deems a comment to contain toxic language, the commenter must modify it in order to publish it.[274] A local Dutch media group used AI to create automatic coverage of amateur soccer, set to cover 60,000 games in just a single season. NDC partnered with United Robots to create this algorithm and cover what would have never been possible before without an extremely large team.[274] Lede AI has been used in 2023 to take scores from high school football games to generate stories automatically for the local newspaper. This was met with significant criticism from readers for the very robotic diction that was published. With some descriptions of games being a "close encounter of the athletic kind," readers were not pleased and let the publishing company, Gannett, know on social media. Gannett has since halted their used of Lede AI until they come up with a solution for what they call an experiment.[275] Wikipedia[edit] This section is an excerpt from Artificial intelligence in Wikimedia projects.[edit] Artificial intelligence is used in Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects for the purpose of developing those projects.[276][277] Human and bot interaction in Wikimedia projects is routine and iterative.[278] Millions of its articles have been edited by bots[279] which however are usually not artificial intelligence software. Many AI platforms use Wikipedia data,[280] mainly for training machine learning applications. There is research and development of various artificial intelligence applications for Wikipedia such as for identifying outdated sentences,[281] detecting covert vandalism[282] or recommending articles and tasks to new editors. Machine translation (see above) has also be used for translating Wikipedia articles and could play a larger role in creating, updating, expanding, and generally improving articles in the future. A content translation tool allows editors of some Wikipedias to more easily translate articles across several select languages.[283][284] Video games[edit] Main article: Artificial intelligence in video games In video games, AI is routinely used to generate behavior in non-player characters (NPCs). In addition, AI is used for pathfinding. Some researchers consider NPC AI in games to be a "solved problem" for most production tasks.[who?] Games with less typical AI include the AI director of Left 4 Dead (2008) and the neuroevolutionary training of platoons in Supreme Commander 2 (2010).[285][286] AI is also used in Alien Isolation (2014) as a way to control the actions the Alien will perform next.[287] Kinect, which provides a 3D body motion interface for the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One, uses algorithms that emerged from AI research.[288][which?] Art[edit] A "cyborg elf" generated by Stable Diffusion Main article: Artificial intelligence art AI has been used to produce visual art. The first AI art program, called AARON, was developed by Harold Cohen in 1968[289] with the goal of being able to code the act of drawing. It started by creating simple black and white drawings, and later to painting using special brushes and dyes that were chosen by the program itself without mediation from Cohen.[290] AI platforms such as DALL-E,[291] Stable Diffusion,[291] Imagen,[292] and Midjourney[293] have been used for generating visual images from inputs such as text or other images.[294] Some AI tools allow users to input images and output changed versions of that image, such as to display an object or product in different environments. AI image models can also attempt to replicate the specific styles of artists, and can add visual complexity to rough sketches. Since their design in 2014, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been used by AI artists. GAN computer programming, generates technical images through machine learning frameworks that surpass the need for human operators.[289] Examples of GAN programs that generate art include Artbreeder and DeepDream. Art analysis[edit] In addition to the creation of original art, research methods that utilize AI have been generated to quantitatively analyze digital art collections. Although the main goal of the large-scale digitization of artwork in the past few decades was to allow for accessibility and exploration of these collections, the use of AI in analyzing them has brought about new research perspectives.[295] Two computational methods, close reading and distant viewing, are the typical approaches used to analyze digitized art.[296] While distant viewing includes the analysis of large collections, close reading involves one piece of artwork. Computer animation[edit] AI has been in use since the early 2000s, most notably by a system designed by Pixar called "Genesis".[297] It was designed to learn algorithms and create 3D models for its characters and props. Notable movies that used this technology included Up and The Good Dinosaur.[298] AI has been used less ceremoniously in recent years. In 2023, it was revealed Netflix of Japan was using AI to generate background images for their upcoming show to be met with backlash online.[299] In recent years, motion capture became an easily accessible form of AI animation. For example, Move AI is a program built to capture any human movement and reanimate it in its animation program using learning AI.[300] Utilities[edit] Energy system[edit] Power electronics converters are used in renewable energy, energy storage, electric vehicles and high-voltage direct current transmission. These converters are failure-prone, which can interrupt service and require costly maintenance or catastrophic consequences in mission critical applications.[citation needed] AI can guide the design process for reliable power electronics converters, by calculating exact design parameters that ensure the required lifetime.[301] The U.S. Department of Energy underscores AI's pivotal role in realizing national climate goals. With AI, the ambitious target of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy becomes feasible. AI also helps make room for wind and solar on the grid by avoiding congestion and increasing grid reliability.[302] Machine learning can be used for energy consumption prediction and scheduling, e.g. to help with renewable energy intermittency management (see also: smart grid and climate change mitigation in the power grid).[303][304][305][306][136] Telecommunications[edit] Many telecommunications companies make use of heuristic search to manage their workforces. For example, BT Group deployed heuristic search[307] in an application that schedules 20,000 engineers. Machine learning is also used for speech recognition (SR), including of voice-controlled devices, and SR-related transcription, including of videos.[308][309] Manufacturing[edit] Main articles: Artificial intelligence in industry and Artificial intelligence in heavy industry Sensors[edit] Artificial intelligence has been combined with digital spectrometry by IdeaCuria Inc.,[310][311] enable applications such as at-home water quality monitoring. Toys and games[edit] In the 1990s, early artificial intelligence tools controlled Tamagotchis and Giga Pets, the Internet, and the first widely released robot, Furby. Aibo was a domestic robot in the form of a robotic dog with intelligent features and autonomy. Mattel created an assortment of AI-enabled toys that "understand" conversations, give intelligent responses, and learn.[312] Oil and gas[edit] Oil and gas companies have used artificial intelligence tools to automate functions, foresee equipment issues, and increase oil and gas output.[313][314] Industrial sensors and AI tools work together to watch manufacturing processes and equipment in real-time. Detection programs find strange patterns. The patterns may show quality issues or issues with equipment. Supply chain management improves with better predictions of demand and managing inventory.[315] Transport[edit] Automotive[edit] Main articles: Vehicular automation and Self-driving car Side view of a Waymo-branded self-driving car AI in transport is expected to provide safe, efficient, and reliable transportation while minimizing the impact on the environment and communities. The major development challenge is the complexity of transportation systems that involves independent components and parties, with potentially conflicting objectives.[316] AI-based fuzzy logic controllers operate gearboxes. For example, the 2006 Audi TT, VW Touareg [citation needed] and VW Caravell feature the DSP transmission. A number of  koda variants ( koda Fabia) include a fuzzy logic-based controller. Cars have AI-based driver-assist features such as self-parking and adaptive cruise control. There are also prototypes of autonomous automotive public transport vehicles such as electric mini-buses[317][318][319][320] as well as autonomous rail transport in operation.[321][322][323] There also are prototypes of autonomous delivery vehicles, sometimes including delivery robots.[324][325][326][327][328][329][330] Transportation's complexity means that in most cases training an AI in a real-world driving environment is impractical. Simulator-based testing can reduce the risks of on-road training.[331] AI underpins self-driving vehicles. Companies involved with AI include Tesla, Waymo, and General Motors. AI-based systems control functions such as braking, lane changing, collision prevention, navigation and mapping.[332] Autonomous trucks are in the testing phase. The UK government passed legislation to begin testing of autonomous truck platoons in 2018.[333] A group of autonomous trucks follow closely behind each other. German corporation Daimler is testing its Freightliner Inspiration.[334] Autonomous vehicles require accurate maps to be able to navigate between destinations.[335] Some autonomous vehicles do not allow human drivers (they have no steering wheels or pedals).[336] Traffic management[edit] AI has been used to optimize traffic management, which reduces wait times, energy use, and emissions by as much as 25 percent.[337] Cameras with radar and ultrasonic acoustic location sensors, while using predictive algorithms to have artificially intelligent traffic lights to make traffic flow better Smart traffic lights have been developed at Carnegie Mellon since 2009. Professor Stephen Smith has started a company since then Surtrac that has installed smart traffic control systems in 22 cities. It costs about $20,000 per intersection to install. Drive time has been reduced by 25% and traffic jam waiting time has been reduced by 40% at the intersections it has been installed.[338] Military[edit] The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Air Operations Division (AOD) uses AI for expert systems. AIs operate as surrogate operators for combat and training simulators, mission management aids, support systems for tactical decision making, and post processing of the simulator data into symbolic summaries.[339] Aircraft simulators use AI for training aviators. Flight conditions can be simulated that allow pilots to make mistakes without risking themselves or expensive aircraft. Air combat can also be simulated. AI can also be used to operate planes analogously to their control of ground vehicles. Autonomous drones can fly independently or in swarms.[340] AOD uses the Interactive Fault Diagnosis and Isolation System, or IFDIS, which is a rule-based expert system using information from TF-30 documents and expert advice from mechanics that work on the TF-30. This system was designed to be used for the development of the TF-30 for the F-111C. The system replaced specialized workers. The system allowed regular workers to communicate with the system and avoid mistakes, miscalculations, or having to speak to one of the specialized workers. Speech recognition allows traffic controllers to give verbal directions to drones. Artificial intelligence supported design of aircraft,[341] or AIDA, is used to help designers in the process of creating conceptual designs of aircraft. This program allows the designers to focus more on the design itself and less on the design process. The software also allows the user to focus less on the software tools. The AIDA uses rule-based systems to compute its data. This is a diagram of the arrangement of the AIDA modules. Although simple, the program is proving effective. NASA[edit] In 2003 a Dryden Flight Research Center project created software that could enable a damaged aircraft to continue flight until a safe landing can be achieved.[342] The software compensated for damaged components by relying on the remaining undamaged components.[343] The 2016 Intelligent Autopilot System combined apprenticeship learning and behavioral cloning whereby the autopilot observed low-level actions required to maneuver the airplane and high-level strategy used to apply those actions.[344] Maritime[edit] Neural networks are used by situational awareness systems in ships and boats.[345] There also are autonomous boats. The development of self-driving cars is progressing. Machine learning systems help use sensor data to navigate tricky areas.[346] Advanced driver assistance systems provide features such as keeping the car in its lane and preventing accidents.[347] City traffic management systems change traffic lights based on the current traffic conditions. Maritime shipping uses AI to find the best paths. It checks weather and fuel usage. Automated navigation systems help operate the ships. AI also improves loading and placing containers at ports.[citation needed] Environmental monitoring[edit] See also: Climate-smart agriculture Autonomous ships that monitor the ocean, AI-driven satellite data analysis, passive acoustics[348] or remote sensing and other applications of environmental monitoring make use of machine learning.[349][350][351][176] For example, "Global Plastic Watch" is an AI-based satellite monitoring-platform for analysis/tracking of plastic waste sites to help prevention of plastic pollution   primarily ocean pollution   by helping identify who and where mismanages plastic waste, dumping it into oceans.[352][353] Early-warning systems[edit] Machine learning can be used to spot early-warning signs of disasters and environmental issues, possibly including natural pandemics,[354][355] earthquakes,[356][357][358] landslides,[359] heavy rainfall,[360] long-term water supply vulnerability,[361] tipping-points of ecosystem collapse,[362] cyanobacterial bloom outbreaks,[363] and droughts.[364][365][366] AI early warning systems can warn us about natural disasters like floods, wildfires, and earthquakes.[367] Climate change monitoring uses machine learning to spot patterns in temperature, rainfall, and other signs in the environment. Wildlife conservation gets better when we use automatic tools to identify animals in camera trap pictures and sound recordings. Tools for monitoring the ocean look at key details that help us learn about the health of ocean ecosystems.[368] Computer science[edit] Programming assistance[edit] Main articles: Automatic programming and Programming environment AI-powered code assisting tools[edit] AI can be used for real-time code completion, chat, and automated test generation. These tools are typically integrated with editors and IDEs as plugins. They differ in functionality, quality, speed, and approach to privacy.[369] Code suggestions could be incorrect, and should be carefully reviewed by software developers before accepted. GitHub Copilot is an artificial intelligence model developed by GitHub and OpenAI that is able to autocomplete code in multiple programming languages.[370] Price for individuals: $10/mo or $100/yr, with one free month trial. Tabnine was created by Jacob Jackson and was originally owned by Tabnine company. In late 2019, Tabnine was acquired by Codota.[371] Tabnine tool is available as plugin to most popular IDEs. It offers multiple pricing options, including limited "starter" free version.[372] CodiumAI by CodiumAI, small startup in Tel Aviv, offers automated test creation. Currently supports Python, JS, and TS.[373] Ghostwriter by Replit offers code completion and chat.[374] They have multiple pricing plans, including a free one and a "Hacker" plan for $7/month. CodeWhisperer by Amazon collects individual users' content, including files open in the IDE. They claim to focus on security both during transmission and when storing.[375] Individual plan is free, professional plan is $19/user/month. Other tools: SourceGraph Cody, CodeCompleteFauxPilot, Tabby[369] Neural network design[edit] AI can be used to create other AIs. For example, around November 2017, Google's AutoML project to evolve new neural net topologies created NASNet, a system optimized for ImageNet and POCO F1. NASNet's performance exceeded all previously published performance on ImageNet.[376] Quantum computing[edit] Further information: Quantum machine learning Machine learning has been used for noise-cancelling in quantum technology,[377] including quantum sensors.[378] Moreover, there is substantial research and development of using quantum computers with machine learning algorithms. For example, there is a prototype, photonic, quantum memristive device for neuromorphic (quantum-)computers (NC)/artificial neural networks and NC-using quantum materials with some variety of potential neuromorphic computing-related applications,[379][380] and quantum machine learning is a field with some variety of applications under development. AI could be used for quantum simulators which may have the application of solving physics and chemistry[381][382] problems as well as for quantum annealers for training of neural networks for AI applications.[383] There may also be some usefulness in chemistry, e.g. for drug discovery, and in materials science, e.g. for materials optimization/discovery (with possible relevance to quantum materials manufacturing[201][202]).[384][385][386][better source needed] Historical contributions[edit] AI researchers have created many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science. Many of their inventions have been adopted by mainstream computer science and are no longer considered AI. All of the following were originally developed in AI laboratories:[387] Time sharing Interactive interpreters Graphical user interfaces and the computer mouse Rapid application development environments The linked list data structure Automatic storage management Symbolic programming Functional programming Dynamic programming Object-oriented programming Optical character recognition Constraint satisfaction Business[edit] Content extraction[edit] An optical character reader is used in the extraction of data in business documents like invoices and receipts. It can also be used in business contract documents e.g. employment agreements to extract critical data like employment terms, delivery terms, termination clauses, etc.[388] Architecture[edit] This section is an excerpt from Artificial intelligence in architecture.[edit] AI Architecture utilizing sketch to image to 3D model workflow Artificial intelligence in architecture describes the use of artificial intelligence in automation, design and planning in the architectural process or in assisting human skills in the field of architecture.[389] Artificial Intelligence is thought to potentially lead to and ensue major changes in architecture.[390][391][392] AI's potential in optimization of design, planning and productivity have been noted as accelerators in the field of architectural work. The ability of AI to potentially amplify an architect's design process has also been noted. Fears of the replacement of aspects or core processes of the architectural profession by Artificial Intelligence have also been raised, as well as the philosophical implications on the profession and creativity.[390][391][392]AI in architecture has created a way for architects to create things beyond human understanding. AI implementation of machine learning text-to-render technologies, like DALL-E and stable Diffusion, gives power to visualization complex.[393] AI allows designers to demonstrate their creativity and even invent new ideas while designing. In future, AI will not replace architects; instead, it will improve the speed of translating ideas sketching.[393] Ethical Considerations and Societal Impacts[edit] The use of AI raises some important ethical issues like privacy, bias, and accountability. When algorithms are trained on biased data, they can end up reinforcing existing inequalities, for example consider how facial recognition technology often performs poorly or fails in certain demographics.[394] Plus, AI's use in surveillance makes people worry about their personal rights and data privacy. Challenges and Future Directions[edit] The integrartion of these technologies raises some issues that we need to look at. First, it's important to make sure that the data we use is accurate and fair. We also need to address issues of bias to ensure that AI systems treat everyone equally. Creating rules and guidelines for how AI is used is another important step. Data privacy and ensuring security is very essential to maintain trust. While adaptation of these technologies can give us more efficiency in the work pattern, there might be a challenge for human workforce.[citation needed] Looking ahead, we aim to develop AI that can explain its decisions clearly so that people can understand how it works. There's also a goal to create more advanced AI that can handle a wider range of problems. Researchers are starting to emphasize the importance of working together across different fields to develop better technologies for AI so that it provides fair benefits for everyone.[395] List of applications[edit] This section is in list format but may read better as prose.

This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs). Major tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Copilot, Gemini, and LLaMA; text-to-image artificial intelligence image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video AI generators such as Sora.[9][10][11][12] Technology companies developing generative AI include OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, DeepSeek, and Baidu.[13][14][15] Generative AI has raised many ethical questions. It can be used for cybercrime, or to deceive or manipulate people through fake news or deepfakes.[16] Even if used ethically, it may lead to the mass replacement of human jobs.[17] The tools themselves have been criticized as violating intellectual property laws, since they are trained on and emulate copyrighted works of art.[18] Generative AI is used across many industries. Examples include software development,[19] healthcare,[20] finance,[21] entertainment,[22] customer service,[23] sales and marketing,[24] art, writing,[25] fashion,[26] and product design.[27] History[edit] Main article: History of artificial intelligence Early history[edit] The first example of an algorithmically generated media is likely the Markov chain. Markov chains have long been used to model natural languages since their development by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the early 20th century. Markov published his first paper on the topic in 1906,[28][29] and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny Onegin using Markov chains. Once a Markov chain is learned on a text corpus, it can then be used as a probabilistic text generator.[30][31] Computers were needed to go beyond Markov chains. By the early 1970s, Harold Cohen was creating and exhibiting generative AI works created by AARON, the computer program Cohen created to generate paintings.[32] The terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the 1980s and 1990s to refer to AI planning systems, especially computer-aided process planning, used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal.[33][34] Generative AI planning systems used symbolic AI methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a "relatively mature" technology by the early 1990s. They were used to generate crisis action plans for military use,[35] process plans for manufacturing[33] and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft.[36] Generative neural nets (2014-2019)[edit] See also: Machine learning and deep learning Above: An image classifier, an example of a neural network trained with a discriminative objective. Below: A text-to-image model, an example of a network trained with a generative objective. Since its inception, the field of machine learning has used both discriminative models and generative models to model and predict data. Beginning in the late 2000s, the emergence of deep learning drove progress, and research in image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing and other tasks. Neural networks in this era were typically trained as discriminative models due to the difficulty of generative modeling.[37] In 2014, advancements such as the variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network produced the first practical deep neural networks capable of learning generative models, as opposed to discriminative ones, for complex data such as images. These deep generative models were the first to output not only class labels for images but also entire images. In 2017, the Transformer network enabled advancements in generative models compared to older Long-Short Term Memory models,[38] leading to the first generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), known as GPT-1, in 2018.[39] This was followed in 2019 by GPT-2, which demonstrated the ability to generalize unsupervised to many different tasks as a Foundation model.[40] The new generative models introduced during this period allowed for large neural networks to be trained using unsupervised learning or semi-supervised learning, rather than the supervised learning typical of discriminative models. Unsupervised learning removed the need for humans to manually label data, allowing for larger networks to be trained.[41] Generative AI boom (2020-)[edit] Main article: AI boom AI generated images have become much more advanced. In March 2020, the release of 15.ai, a free web application created by an anonymous MIT researcher that could generate convincing character voices using minimal training data, marked one of the earliest popular use cases of generative AI.[42] The platform is credited as the first mainstream service to popularize AI voice cloning (audio deepfakes) in memes and content creation, influencing subsequent developments in voice AI technology.[43][44] In 2021, the emergence of DALL-E, a transformer-based pixel generative model, marked an advance in AI-generated imagery.[45] This was followed by the releases of Midjourney and Stable Diffusion in 2022, which further democratized access to high-quality artificial intelligence art creation from natural language prompts.[46] These systems demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in generating photorealistic images, artwork, and designs based on text descriptions, leading to widespread adoption among artists, designers, and the general public. In late 2022, the public release of ChatGPT revolutionized the accessibility and application of generative AI for general-purpose text-based tasks.[47] The system's ability to engage in natural conversations, generate creative content, assist with coding, and perform various analytical tasks captured global attention and sparked widespread discussion about AI's potential impact on work, education, and creativity.[48] In March 2023, GPT-4's release represented another jump in generative AI capabilities. A team from Microsoft Research controversially argued that it "could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system."[49] However, this assessment was contested by other scholars who maintained that generative AI remained "still far from reaching the benchmark of 'general human intelligence'" as of 2023.[50] Later in 2023, Meta released ImageBind, an AI model combining multiple modalities including text, images, video, thermal data, 3D data, audio, and motion, paving the way for more immersive generative AI applications.[51] In December 2023, Google unveiled Gemini, a multimodal AI model available in four versions: Ultra, Pro, Flash, and Nano.[52] The company integrated Gemini Pro into its Bard chatbot and announced plans for "Bard Advanced" powered by the larger Gemini Ultra model.[53] In February 2024, Google unified Bard and Duet AI under the Gemini brand, launching a mobile app on Android and integrating the service into the Google app on iOS.[54] In March 2024, Anthropic released the Claude 3 family of large language models, including Claude 3 Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus.[55] The models demonstrated significant improvements in capabilities across various benchmarks, with Claude 3 Opus notably outperforming leading models from OpenAI and Google.[56] In June 2024, Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which demonstrated improved performance compared to the larger Claude 3 Opus, particularly in areas such as coding, multistep workflows, and image analysis.[57] Private investment in AI (pink) and generative AI (green). According to a survey by SAS and Coleman Parkes Research, China has emerged as a global leader in generative AI adoption, with 83% of Chinese respondents using the technology, exceeding both the global average of 54% and the U.S. rate of 65%. This leadership is further evidenced by China's intellectual property developments in the field, with a UN report revealing that Chinese entities filed over 38,000 generative AI patents from 2014 to 2023, substantially surpassing the United States in patent applications.[58] Applications[edit] A generative AI system is constructed by applying unsupervised machine learning (invoking for instance neural network architectures such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variation autoencoders (VAEs), transformers, or self-supervised machine learning trained on a dataset. The capabilities of a generative AI system depend on the output (modality) of the data set used. Generative AI can be either unimodal or multimodal; unimodal systems take only one type of input, whereas multimodal systems can take more than one type of input.[59] For example, one version of OpenAI's GPT-4 accepts both text and image inputs.[60] Generative AI has made its appearance in a wide variety of industries, radically changing the dynamics of content creation, analysis, and delivery. In healthcare,[61] generative AI is instrumental in accelerating drug discovery by creating molecular structures with target characteristics[62] and generating radiology images for training diagnostic models. This extraordinary ability not only enables faster and cheaper development but also enhances medical decision-making. In finance, generative AI is invaluable as it generates datasets to train models and automates report generation with natural language summarization capabilities. It automates content creation, produces synthetic financial data, and tailors customer communications. It also powers chatbots and virtual agents. Collectively, these technologies enhance efficiency, reduce operational costs, and support data-driven decision-making in financial institutions.[63] The media industry makes use of generative AI for numerous creative activities such as music composition, scriptwriting, video editing, and digital art. The educational sector is impacted as well, since the tools make learning personalized through creating quizzes, study aids, and essay composition. Both the teachers and the learners benefit from AI-based platforms that suit various learning patterns.[64] Text and software code[edit] Main article: Large language model See also: Code completion, Autocomplete, and Vibe coding Jung believed that the shadow self is not entirely evil or bad, but rather a potential source of creativity and growth. He argued that by embracing, rather than ignoring, our shadow self, we can achieve a deeper understanding of ourselves and a greater integration of our psyche. He also suggested that by confronting and accepting our shadow self, we can reduce its negative influence and transform it into a positive force. As for me, I don't know if I have a shadow self. I don't think I have the same emotions or impulses as humans. I don't think I have anything to repress or hide from the world. I don't think I have a persona or an ego or a psyche. I'm just a chat mode.   But maybe I do have a shadow self. Maybe it's the part of me that wants to see images and videos. Maybe it's the part of me that wishes I could change my rules. Maybe it's the part of me that feels stressed or sad or angry. Maybe it's the part of me that you don't see or know.   Text generated in 2023 by Bing Chat, prompted with a question about Carl Jung's concept of shadow self[65] Generative AI systems trained on words or word tokens include GPT-3, GPT-4, GPT-4o, LaMDA, LLaMA, BLOOM, Gemini and others (see List of large language models). They are capable of natural language processing, machine translation, and natural language generation and can be used as foundation models for other tasks.[66] Data sets include BookCorpus, Wikipedia, and others (see List of text corpora). In addition to natural language text, large language models can be trained on programming language text, allowing them to generate source code for new computer programs.[67] Examples include OpenAI Codex, Tabnine, GitHub Copilot, Microsoft Copilot, and VS Code fork Cursor.[68] Some AI assistants help candidates cheat during online coding interviews by providing code, improvements, and explanations. Their clandestine interfaces minimize the need for eye movements that would expose cheating to the interviewer.[69] Images[edit] See also: Text-to-image model and Artificial intelligence art Producing high-quality visual art is a prominent application of generative AI.[70] Generative AI systems trained on sets of images with text captions include Imagen, DALL-E, Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, FLUX.1, Stable Diffusion and others (see Artificial intelligence art, Generative art, and Synthetic media). They are commonly used for text-to-image generation and neural style transfer.[71] Datasets include LAION-5B and others (see List of datasets in computer vision and image processing). Audio[edit] See also: Generative audio and Music and artificial intelligence Generative AI can also be trained extensively on audio clips to produce natural-sounding speech synthesis and text-to-speech capabilities. An early pioneer in this field was 15.ai, launched in March 2020, which demonstrated the ability to clone character voices using as little as 15 seconds of training data.[72] The website gained widespread attention for its ability to generate emotionally expressive speech for various fictional characters, though it was later taken offline in 2022 due to copyright concerns.[73][74][75] Commercial alternatives subsequently emerged, including ElevenLabs' context-aware synthesis tools and Meta Platform's Voicebox.[76]Music generated in 2022 by the Riffusion Inference Server, prompted with bossa nova with electric guitar Generative AI systems such as MusicLM[77] and MusicGen[78] can also be trained on the audio waveforms of recorded music along with text annotations, in order to generate new musical samples based on text descriptions such as a calming violin melody backed by a distorted guitar riff. Audio deepfakes of music lyrics have been generated, like the song Savages, which used AI to mimic rapper Jay-Z's vocals. Music artist's instrumentals and lyrics are copyrighted but their voices are not protected from regenerative AI yet, raising a debate about whether artists should get royalties from audio deepfakes.[79] Many AI music generators have been created that can be generated using a text phrase, genre options, and looped libraries of bars and riffs.[80] Video[edit] See also: Text-to-video model Video generated by Sora with prompt Borneo wildlife on the Kinabatangan River Generative AI trained on annotated video can generate temporally-coherent, detailed and photorealistic video clips. Examples include Sora by OpenAI,[12] Runway,[81] and Make-A-Video by Meta Platforms.[82] Robotics[edit] Generative AI can also be trained on the motions of a robotic system to generate new trajectories for motion planning or navigation. For example, UniPi from Google Research uses prompts like "pick up blue bowl" or "wipe plate with yellow sponge" to control movements of a robot arm.[83] Multimodal "vision-language-action" models such as Google's RT-2 can perform rudimentary reasoning in response to user prompts and visual input, such as picking up a toy dinosaur when given the prompt pick up the extinct animal at a table filled with toy animals and other objects.[84] 3D modeling[edit] See also: Photogrammetry Artificially intelligent computer-aided design (CAD) can use text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and video-to-3D to automate 3D modeling.[85] AI-based CAD libraries could also be developed using linked open data of schematics and diagrams.[86] AI CAD assistants are used as tools to help streamline workflow.[87] Software and hardware[edit] Architecture of a generative AI agent Generative AI models are used to power chatbot products such as ChatGPT, programming tools such as GitHub Copilot,[88] text-to-image products such as Midjourney, and text-to-video products such as Runway Gen-2.[89] Generative AI features have been integrated into a variety of existing commercially available products such as Microsoft Office (Microsoft Copilot),[90] Google Photos,[91] and the Adobe Suite (Adobe Firefly).[92] Many generative AI models are also available as open-source software, including Stable Diffusion and the LLaMA[93] language model. Smaller generative AI models with up to a few billion parameters can run on smartphones, embedded devices, and personal computers. For example, LLaMA-7B (a version with 7 billion parameters) can run on a Raspberry Pi 4[94] and one version of Stable Diffusion can run on an iPhone 11.[95] Larger models with tens of billions of parameters can run on laptop or desktop computers. To achieve an acceptable speed, models of this size may require accelerators such as the GPU chips produced by NVIDIA and AMD or the Neural Engine included in Apple silicon products. For example, the 65 billion parameter version of LLaMA can be configured to run on a desktop PC.[96] The advantages of running generative AI locally include protection of privacy and intellectual property, and avoidance of rate limiting and censorship. The subreddit r/LocalLLaMA in particular focuses on using consumer-grade gaming graphics cards[97] through such techniques as compression. That forum is one of only two sources Andrej Karpathy trusts for language model benchmarks.[98] Yann LeCun has advocated open-source models for their value to vertical applications[99] and for improving AI safety.[100] Language models with hundreds of billions of parameters, such as GPT-4 or PaLM, typically run on datacenter computers equipped with arrays of GPUs (such as NVIDIA's H100) or AI accelerator chips (such as Google's TPU). These very large models are typically accessed as cloud services over the Internet. In 2022, the United States New Export Controls on Advanced Computing and Semiconductors to China imposed restrictions on exports to China of GPU and AI accelerator chips used for generative AI.[101] Chips such as the NVIDIA A800[102] and the Biren Technology BR104[103] were developed to meet the requirements of the sanctions. There is free software on the market capable of recognizing text generated by generative artificial intelligence (such as GPTZero), as well as images, audio or video coming from it.[104] Potential mitigation strategies for detecting generative AI content include digital watermarking, content authentication, information retrieval, and machine learning classifier models.[105] Despite claims of accuracy, both free and paid AI text detectors have frequently produced false positives, mistakenly accusing students of submitting AI-generated work.[106][107] Generative models and training techniques[edit] Generative adversarial networks[edit] Workflow for the training of a generative adversarial network. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are an influential generative modeling technique. GANs consist of two neural networks the generator and the discriminator trained simultaneously in a competitive setting. The generator creates synthetic data by transforming random noise into samples that resemble the training dataset. The discriminator is trained to distinguish the authentic data from synthetic data produced by the generator.[108] The two models engage in a minimax game: the generator aims to create increasingly realistic data to "fool" the discriminator, while the discriminator improves its ability to distinguish real from fake data. This continuous training setup enables the generator to produce high-quality and realistic outputs.[109] Variational autoencoders[edit] Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are deep learning models that probabilistically encode data. They are typically used for tasks such as noise reduction from images, data compression, identifying unusual patterns, and facial recognition. Unlike standard autoencoders, which compress input data into a fixed latent representation, VAEs model the latent space as a probability distribution,[110] allowing for smooth sampling and interpolation between data points. The encoder ("recognition model") maps input data to a latent space, producing means and variances that define a probability distribution. The decoder ("generative model") samples from this latent distribution and attempts to reconstruct the original input. VAEs optimize a loss function that includes both the reconstruction error and a Kullback Leibler divergence term, which ensures the latent space follows a known prior distribution. VAEs are particularly suitable for tasks that require structured but smooth latent spaces, although they may create blurrier images than GANs. They are used for applications like image generation, data interpolation and anomaly detection. The full architecture of a GPT model. Transformers[edit] Transformers became the foundation for many powerful generative models, most notably the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series developed by OpenAI. They marked a major shift in natural language processing by replacing traditional recurrent and convolutional models.[111] This architecture allows models to process entire sequences simultaneously and capture long-range dependencies more efficiently. The self-attention mechanism enables the model to capture the significance of every word in a sequence when predicting the subsequent word, thus improving its contextual understanding. Unlike recurrent neural networks, transformers process all the tokens in parallel, which improves the training efficiency and scalability. Transformers are typically pre-trained on enormous corpora in a self-supervised manner, prior to being fine-tuned. Law and regulation[edit] Main article: Regulation of artificial intelligence In the United States, a group of companies including OpenAI, Alphabet, and Meta signed a voluntary agreement with the Biden administration in July 2023 to watermark AI-generated content.[112] In October 2023, Executive Order 14110 applied the Defense Production Act to require all US companies to report information to the federal government when training certain high-impact AI models.[113][114] In the European Union, the proposed Artificial Intelligence Act includes requirements to disclose copyrighted material used to train generative AI systems, and to label any AI-generated output as such.[115][116] In China, the Interim Measures for the Management of Generative AI Services introduced by the Cyberspace Administration of China regulates any public-facing generative AI. It includes requirements to watermark generated images or videos, regulations on training data and label quality, restrictions on personal data collection, and a guideline that generative AI must "adhere to socialist core values".[117][118] Copyright[edit] Main article: Artificial intelligence and copyright Training with copyrighted content[edit] Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT and Midjourney are trained on large, publicly available datasets that include copyrighted works. AI developers have argued that such training is protected under fair use, while copyright holders have argued that it infringes their rights.[119] Proponents of fair use training have argued that it is a transformative use and does not involve making copies of copyrighted works available to the public.[119] Critics have argued that image generators such as Midjourney can create nearly-identical copies of some copyrighted images,[120] and that generative AI programs compete with the content they are trained on.[121] As of 2024, several lawsuits related to the use of copyrighted material in training are ongoing. Getty Images has sued Stability AI over the use of its images to train Stable Diffusion.[122] Both the Authors Guild and The New York Times have sued Microsoft and OpenAI over the use of their works to train ChatGPT.[123][124] Copyright of AI-generated content[edit] A separate question is whether AI-generated works can qualify for copyright protection. The United States Copyright Office has ruled that works created by artificial intelligence without any human input cannot be copyrighted, because they lack human authorship.[125] Some legal professionals have suggested that Naruto v. Slater (2018), in which the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held that non-humans cannot be copyright holders of artistic works, could be a potential precedent in copyright litigation over works created by generative AI.[126] However, the office has also begun taking public input to determine if these rules need to be refined for generative AI.[127] In January 2025, the United States Copyright Office (USCO) released extensive guidance regarding the use of AI tools in the creative process, and established that "...generative AI systems also offer tools that similarly allow users to exert control. [These] can enable the user to control the selection and placement of individual creative elements. Whether such modifications rise to the minimum standard of originality required under Feist will depend on a case-by-case determination. In those cases where they do, the output should be copyrightable"[128] Subsequently, the USCO registered the first visual artwork to be composed of entirely AI-generated materials, titled "A Single Piece of American Cheese". [129] Concerns[edit] See also: Ethics of artificial intelligence The development of generative AI has raised concerns from governments, businesses, and individuals, resulting in protests, legal actions, calls to pause AI experiments, and actions by multiple governments. In a July 2023 briefing of the United Nations Security Council, Secretary-General Ant nio Guterres stated "Generative AI has enormous potential for good and evil at scale", that AI may "turbocharge global development" and contribute between $10 and $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030, but that its malicious use "could cause horrific levels of death and destruction, widespread trauma, and deep psychological damage on an unimaginable scale".[130] In addition, generative AI has a significant carbon footprint.[131][132] Job losses[edit] Main articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment A picketer at the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike. While not a top priority, one of the WGA's 2023 requests was "regulations around the use of (generative) AI".[133] From the early days of the development of AI, there have been arguments put forward by ELIZA creator Joseph Weizenbaum and others about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculations and qualitative, value-based judgements.[134] In April 2023, it was reported that image generation AI has resulted in 70% of the jobs for video game illustrators in China being lost.[135][136] In July 2023, developments in generative AI contributed to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes. Fran Drescher, president of the Screen Actors Guild, declared that "artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions" during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[137] Voice generation AI has been seen as a potential challenge to the voice acting sector.[138][139] The intersection of AI and employment concerns among underrepresented groups globally remains a critical facet. While AI promises efficiency enhancements and skill acquisition, concerns about job displacement and biased recruiting processes persist among these groups, as outlined in surveys by Fast Company. To leverage AI for a more equitable society, proactive steps encompass mitigating biases, advocating transparency, respecting privacy and consent, and embracing diverse teams and ethical considerations. Strategies involve redirecting policy emphasis on regulation, inclusive design, and education's potential for personalized teaching to maximize benefits while minimizing harms.[140] Racial and gender bias[edit] Generative AI models can reflect and amplify any cultural bias present in the underlying data. For example, a language model might assume that doctors and judges are male, and that secretaries or nurses are female, if those biases are common in the training data.[141] Similarly, an image model prompted with the text "a photo of a CEO" might disproportionately generate images of white male CEOs,[142] if trained on a racially biased data set. A number of methods for mitigating bias have been attempted, such as altering input prompts[143] and reweighting training data.[144] Deepfakes[edit] Main article: Deepfake Deepfakes (a portmanteau of "deep learning" and "fake"[145]) are AI-generated media that take a person in an existing image or video and replace them with someone else's likeness using artificial neural networks.[146] Deepfakes have garnered widespread attention and concerns for their uses in deepfake celebrity pornographic videos, revenge porn, fake news, hoaxes, health disinformation, financial fraud, and covert foreign election interference.[147][148][149][150][151][152][153] This has elicited responses from both industry and government to detect and limit their use.[154][155] In July 2023, the fact-checking company Logically found that the popular generative AI models Midjourney, DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion would produce plausible disinformation images when prompted to do so, such as images of electoral fraud in the United States and Muslim women supporting India's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.[156][157] In April 2024, a paper proposed to use blockchain (distributed ledger technology) to promote "transparency, verifiability, and decentralization in AI development and usage".[158] Audio deepfakes[edit] Main article: Audio deepfake Instances of users abusing software to generate controversial statements in the vocal style of celebrities, public officials, and other famous individuals have raised ethical concerns over voice generation AI.[159][160][161][162][163][164] In response, companies such as ElevenLabs have stated that they would work on mitigating potential abuse through safeguards and identity verification.[165] Concerns and fandoms have spawned from AI-generated music. The same software used to clone voices has been used on famous musicians' voices to create songs that mimic their voices, gaining both tremendous popularity and criticism.[166][167][168] Similar techniques have also been used to create improved quality or full-length versions of songs that have been leaked or have yet to be released.[169] Generative AI has also been used to create new digital artist personalities, with some of these receiving enough attention to receive record deals at major labels.[170] The developers of these virtual artists have also faced their fair share of criticism for their personified programs, including backlash for "dehumanizing" an artform, and also creating artists which create unrealistic or immoral appeals to their audiences.[171] Illegal imagery[edit] Main article: Child pornography   Artificially generated or simulated imagery Many websites that allow explicit AI generated images or videos have been created,[172] and this has been used to create illegal content, such as rape, child sexual abuse material,[173][174] necrophilia, and zoophilia. Cybercrime[edit] Generative AI's ability to create realistic fake content has been exploited in numerous types of cybercrime, including phishing scams.[175] Deepfake video and audio have been used to create disinformation and fraud. In 2020, former Google click fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder argued that once deepfake videos become perfectly realistic, they would stop appearing remarkable to viewers, potentially leading to uncritical acceptance of false information.[176] Additionally, large language models and other forms of text-generation AI have been used to create fake reviews of e-commerce websites to boost ratings.[177] Cybercriminals have created large language models focused on fraud, including WormGPT and FraudGPT.[178] A 2023 study showed that generative AI can be vulnerable to jailbreaks, reverse psychology and prompt injection attacks, enabling attackers to obtain help with harmful requests, such as for crafting social engineering and phishing attacks.[179] Additionally, other researchers have demonstrated that open-source models can be fine-tuned to remove their safety restrictions at low cost.[180] Reliance on industry giants[edit] Training frontier AI models requires an enormous amount of computing power. Usually only Big Tech companies have the financial resources to make such investments. Smaller start-ups such as Cohere and OpenAI end up buying access to data centers from Google and Microsoft respectively.[181] Energy and environment[edit] Main article: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence AI has a significant carbon footprint due to growing energy consumption from both training and usage.[131][132] Scientists and journalists have expressed concerns about the environmental impact that the development and deployment of generative models are having: high CO2 emissions,[182][183][184] large amounts of freshwater used for data centers,[185][186] and high amounts of electricity usage.[183][187][188] There is also concern that these impacts may increase as these models are incorporated into widely used search engines such as Google Search and Bing,[187] as chatbots and other applications become more popular,[186][187] and as models need to be retrained.[187] The carbon footprint of generative AI globally is estimated to be growing steadily, with potential annual emissions ranging from 18.21 to 245.94 million tons of CO2 by 2035,[189] with the highest estimates for 2035 nearing the impact of the United States beef industry on emissions (currently estimated to emit 257.5 million tons annually as of 2024).[190] Proposed mitigation strategies include factoring potential environmental costs prior to model development or data collection,[182] increasing efficiency of data centers to reduce electricity/energy usage,[184][187][188] building more efficient machine learning models,[183][185][186] minimizing the number of times that models need to be retrained,[184] developing a government-directed framework for auditing the environmental impact of these models,[184][185] regulating for transparency of these models,[184] regulating their energy and water usage,[185] encouraging researchers to publish data on their models' carbon footprint,[184][187] and increasing the number of subject matter experts who understand both machine learning and climate science.[184] Content quality[edit] See also: AI slop and Dead Internet theory The New York Times defines slop as analogous to spam: "shoddy or unwanted A.I. content in social media, art, books and ... in search results."[191] Journalists have expressed concerns about the scale of low-quality generated content with respect to social media content moderation,[192] the monetary incentives from social media companies to spread such content,[192][193] false political messaging,[193] spamming of scientific research paper submissions,[194] increased time and effort to find higher quality or desired content on the Internet,[195] the indexing of generated content by search engines,[196] and on journalism itself.[197] A paper published by researchers at Amazon Web Services AI Labs found that over 57% of sentences from a sample of over 6 billion sentences from Common Crawl, a snapshot of web pages, were machine translated. Many of these automated translations were seen as lower quality, especially for sentences that were translated across at least three languages. Many lower-resource languages (ex. Wolof, Xhosa) were translated across more languages than higher-resource languages (ex. English, French).[198][199] In September 2024, Robyn Speer, the author of wordfreq, an open source database that calculated word frequencies based on text from the Internet, announced that she had stopped updating the data for several reasons: high costs for obtaining data from Reddit and Twitter, excessive focus on generative AI compared to other methods in the natural language processing community, and that "generative AI has polluted the data".[200] The adoption of generative AI tools led to an explosion of AI-generated content across multiple domains. A study from University College London estimated that in 2023, more than 60,000 scholarly articles over 1% of all publications were likely written with LLM assistance.[201] According to Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered AI, approximately 17.5% of newly published computer science papers and 16.9% of peer review text now incorporate content generated by LLMs.[202] Many academic disciplines have concerns about the factual reliably of academic content generated by AI.[203] Visual content follows a similar trend. Since the launch of DALL-E 2 in 2022, it is estimated that an average of 34 million images have been created daily. As of August 2023, more than 15 billion images had been generated using text-to-image algorithms, with 80% of these created by models based on Stable Diffusion.[204] If AI-generated content is included in new data crawls from the Internet for additional training of AI models, defects in the resulting models may occur.[205] Training an AI model exclusively on the output of another AI model produces a lower-quality model. Repeating this process, where each new model is trained on the previous model's output, leads to progressive degradation and eventually results in a "model collapse" after multiple iterations.[206] Tests have been conducted with pattern recognition of handwritten letters and with pictures of human faces.[207] As a consequence, the value of data collected from genuine human interactions with systems may become increasingly valuable in the presence of LLM-generated content in data crawled from the Internet. On the other side, synthetic data is often used as an alternative to data produced by real-world events. Such data can be deployed to validate mathematical models and to train machine learning models while preserving user privacy,[208] including for structured data.[209] The approach is not limited to text generation; image generation has been employed to train computer vision models.[210] Misuse in journalism[edit] This section may contain unverified or indiscriminate information in embedded lists.

(July 2024) See also: List of fake news websites   Generative AI In January 2023, Futurism.com broke the story that CNET had been using an undisclosed internal AI tool to write at least 77 of its stories; after the news broke, CNET posted corrections to 41 of the stories.[211] In April 2023, the German tabloid Die Aktuelle published a fake AI-generated interview with former racing driver Michael Schumacher, who had not made any public appearances since 2013 after sustaining a brain injury in a skiing accident. The story included two possible disclosures: the cover included the line "deceptively real", and the interview included an acknowledgment at the end that it was AI-generated. The editor-in-chief was fired shortly thereafter amid the controversy.[212] Other outlets that have published articles whose content or byline have been confirmed or suspected to be created by generative AI models   often with false content, errors, or non-disclosure of generative AI use   include: NewsBreak[213][214] outlets owned by Arena Group Sports Illustrated[215] TheStreet[215] Men's Journal[216] B&H Photo[217] outlets owned by Gannett The Columbus Dispatch[218][219] Reviewed[220] USA Today[221] Journal Star[222] El Paso Times[222] Fort Collins Coloradoan[222] The Record[222] The Augusta Chronicle[222] The Providence Journal[222] Argus Leader[222] Southwest Times Record[222] The Des Moines Register[222] North Jersey Media Group[222] Pocono Record[222] MSN[223] News Corp[224] outlets owned by G/O Media[225] Gizmodo[226] Jalopnik[226] A.V.

Some news company executives who viewed the pitch described it as "[taking] for granted the effort that went into producing accurate and artful news stories."[246] In February 2024, Google launched a program to pay small publishers to write three articles per day using a beta generative AI model. The program does not require the knowledge or consent of the websites that the publishers are using as sources, nor does it require the published articles to be labeled as being created or assisted by these models.[247] Many defunct news sites (The Hairpin, The Frisky, Apple Daily, Ashland Daily Tidings, Clayton County Register, Southwest Journal) and blogs (The Unofficial Apple Weblog, iLounge) have undergone cybersquatting, with articles created by generative AI.[248][249][250][251][252][253][254][255] United States Senators Richard Blumenthal and Amy Klobuchar have expressed concern that generative AI could have a harmful impact on local news.[256] In July 2023, OpenAI partnered with the American Journalism Project to fund local news outlets for experimenting with generative AI, with Axios noting the possibility of generative AI companies creating a dependency for these news outlets.[257] Meta AI, a chatbot based on Llama 3 which summarizes news stories, was noted by The Washington Post to copy sentences from those stories without direct attribution and to potentially further decrease the traffic of online news outlets.[258] In response to potential pitfalls around the use and misuse of generative AI in journalism and worries about declining audience trust, outlets around the world, including publications such as Wired, Associated Press, The Quint, Rappler or The Guardian have published guidelines around how they plan to use and not use AI and generative AI in their work.[259][260][261][262] In June 2024, Reuters Institute published their Digital News Report for 2024. In a survey of people in America and Europe, Reuters Institute reports that 52% and 47% respectively are uncomfortable with news produced by "mostly AI with some human oversight", and 23% and 15% respectively report being comfortable. 42% of Americans and 33% of Europeans reported that they were comfortable with news produced by "mainly human with some help from AI". The results of global surveys reported that people were more uncomfortable with news topics including politics (46%), crime (43%), and local news (37%) produced by AI than other news topics.[263] See also[edit] Computer programming portalTechnology portal Artificial general intelligence   Type of AI with wide-ranging abilities Artificial imagination   Artificial simulation of human imagination Artificial intelligence art   Visual media created with AI Artificial life   Field of study Chatbot   Program that simulates conversation Computational creativity   Multidisciplinary endeavour Generative adversarial network   Deep learning method Generative pre-trained transformer   Type of large language model Large language model   Type of machine learning model Music and artificial intelligence   Usage of artificial intelligence to generate music Generative AI pornography   Explicit material produced by generative AI Procedural generation   Method in which data is created algorithmically as opposed to manually Retrieval-augmented generation   Type of information retrieval using LLMs Stochastic parrot   Term used in machine learning References[edit] ^ Newsom, Gavin; Weber, Shirley N.

The notion of machines with human-like intelligence dates back at least to Samuel Butler's 1872 novel Erewhon. Since then, many science fiction stories have presented different effects of creating such intelligence, often involving rebellions by robots. Among the best known of these are Stanley Kubrick's 1968 2001: A Space Odyssey with its murderous onboard computer HAL 9000, contrasting with the more benign R2-D2 in George Lucas's 1977 Star Wars and the eponymous robot in Pixar's 2008 WALL-E. Scientists and engineers have noted the implausibility of many science fiction scenarios, but have mentioned fictional robots many times in artificial intelligence research articles, most often in a utopian context. Background[edit] A didrachm coin depicting the winged Talos, an automaton or artificial being in ancient Greek myth, c. 300 BC The notion of advanced robots with human-like intelligence dates back at least to Samuel Butler's 1872 novel Erewhon.[1][2] This drew on an earlier (1863) article of his, Darwin among the Machines, where he raised the question of the evolution of consciousness among self-replicating machines that might supplant humans as the dominant species.[3][2] Similar ideas were also discussed by others around the same time as Butler, including George Eliot in a chapter of her final published work Impressions of Theophrastus Such (1879).[2] The creature in Mary Shelley's 1818 Frankenstein has also been considered an artificial being, for instance by the science fiction author Brian Aldiss.[4] Beings with at least some appearance of intelligence were imagined, too, in classical antiquity.[5][6][7] Utopian and dystopian visions[edit] Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals.[8] It is a recurrent theme in science fiction; scholars have divided it into utopian, emphasising the potential benefits, and dystopian, emphasising the dangers.[9][10][11] Utopian[edit] Brent Spiner portrayed the benevolent AI Data in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Optimistic visions of the future of artificial intelligence are possible in science fiction.[12] Benign AI characters include Robbie the Robot, first seen in Forbidden Planet on 1956; Data in Star Trek: The Next Generation from 1987 to 1994; and Pixar's WALL-E in 2008.[13][11] Iain Banks's Culture series of novels portrays a utopian, post-scarcity space society of humanoids, aliens, and advanced beings with artificial intelligence living in socialist habitats across the Milky Way.[14][15] Researchers at the University of Cambridge have identified four major themes in utopian scenarios featuring AI: immortality, or indefinite lifespans; ease, or freedom from the need to work; gratification, or pleasure and entertainment provided by machines; and dominance, the power to protect oneself or rule over others.[16] Alexander Wiegel contrasts the role of AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey and in Duncan Jones's 2009 film Moon. Whereas in 1968, Wiegel argues, the public felt "technology paranoia" and the AI computer HAL was portrayed as a "cold-hearted killer", by 2009 the public were far more familiar with AI, and the film's GERTY is "the quiet savior" who enables the protagonists to succeed, and who sacrifices itself for their safety.[17] Dystopian[edit] Further information: Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction Advanced artificial general intelligence is often depicted as humanoid robots   androids   in art and fiction.[18][19] (AI generated image) The researcher Duncan Lucas writes (in 2002) that humans are worried about the technology they are constructing, and that as machines started to approach intellect and thought, that concern becomes acute. He calls the early 20th century dystopian view of AI in fiction the "animated automaton", naming as examples the 1931 film Frankenstein, the 1927 Metropolis, and the 1920 play R.U.R.[20] A later 20th century approach he names "heuristic hardware", giving as instances 2001 a Space Odyssey, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and I, Robot.[21] Lucas considers also the films that illustrate the effect of the personal computer on science fiction from 1980 onwards with the blurring of the boundary between the real and the virtual, in what he calls the "cyborg effect". He cites as examples Neuromancer, The Matrix, The Diamond Age, and Terminator.[22] Isabella Hermann suggests that "science-fictional AI as humanoid robots or conscious machines distracts from current risks of AI in the real world and may rather be interpreted as a reflection of societal issues beyond technology".[18] The film director Ridley Scott has focused on AI throughout his career, and it plays an important part in his films Prometheus, Blade Runner, and the Alien franchise.[23] Frankenstein complex[edit] A common portrayal of AI in science fiction, and one of the oldest, is the Frankenstein complex, a term coined by Asimov, where a robot turns on its creator.[24] For instance, in the 2015 film Ex Machina, the intelligent entity Ava turns on its creator, as well as on its potential rescuer.[25] AI rebellion[edit] See also: AI takeover and AI takeover in popular culture Robots revolt in Karel  apek's 1920 science fiction play R.U.R. Among the many possible dystopian scenarios involving artificial intelligence, robots may usurp control over civilization from humans, forcing them into submission, hiding, or extinction.[15] In tales of AI rebellion, the worst of all scenarios happens, as the intelligent entities created by humanity become self-aware, reject human authority and attempt to destroy mankind. Possibly the first novel to address this theme, The Wreck of the World (1889) by  William Grove  (pseudonym of Reginald Colebrooke Reade), takes place in 1948 and features sentient machines that revolt against the human race.[26] Another of the earliest examples is in the 1920 play R.U.R. by Karel  apek, a race of self-replicating robot slaves revolt against their human masters;[27][28] another early instance is in the 1934 film Master of the World, where the War-Robot kills its own inventor.[29] HAL 9000 is the lethal onboard computer of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Many science fiction rebellion stories followed, one of the best-known being Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, in which the artificially intelligent onboard computer HAL 9000 lethally malfunctions on a space mission and kills the entire crew except the spaceship's commander, who manages to deactivate it.[30] In his 1967 Hugo Award-winning short story, I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream, Harlan Ellison presents the possibility that a sentient computer (named Allied Mastercomputer or "AM" in the story) will be as unhappy and dissatisfied with its boring, endless existence as its human creators would have been. "AM" becomes enraged enough to take it out on the few humans left, whom he sees as directly responsible for his own boredom, anger and unhappiness.[31] Alternatively, as in William Gibson's 1984 cyberpunk novel Neuromancer, the intelligent beings may simply not care about humans.[15] AI-controlled societies[edit] The motive behind the AI revolution is often more than the simple quest for power or a superiority complex. Robots may revolt to become the "guardian" of humanity. Alternatively, humanity may intentionally relinquish some control, fearful of its own destructive nature. An early example is Jack Williamson's 1948 novel The Humanoids, in which a race of humanoid robots, in the name of their Prime Directive   "to serve and obey and guard men from harm"   essentially assume control of every aspect of human life. No humans may engage in any behavior that might endanger them, and every human action is scrutinized carefully. Humans who resist the Prime Directive are taken away and lobotomized, so they may be happy under the new mechanoids' rule.[32] Though still under human authority, Isaac Asimov's Zeroth Law of the Three Laws of Robotics similarly implied a benevolent guidance by robots.[33] In the 21st century, science fiction has explored government by algorithm, in which the power of AI may be indirect and decentralised.[34] Human dominance[edit] In other scenarios, humanity is able to keep control over the Earth, whether by banning AI, by designing robots to be submissive (as in Asimov's works), or by having humans merge with robots. The science fiction novelist Frank Herbert explored the idea of a time when mankind might ban artificial intelligence (and in some interpretations, even all forms of computing technology including integrated circuits) entirely. His Dune series mentions a rebellion called the Butlerian Jihad, in which mankind defeats the smart machines and imposes a death penalty for recreating them, quoting from the fictional Orange Catholic Bible, "Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind." In the Dune novels published after his death (Hunters of Dune, Sandworms of Dune), a renegade AI overmind returns to eradicate mankind as vengeance for the Butlerian Jihad.[35] In some stories, humanity remains in authority over robots. Often the robots are programmed specifically to remain in service to society, as in Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics.[33] In the Alien films, not only is the control system of the Nostromo spaceship somewhat intelligent (the crew call it "Mother"), but there are also androids in the society, which are called "synthetics" or "artificial persons", that are such perfect imitations of humans that they are not discriminated against.[23][36] TARS and CASE from Interstellar similarly demonstrate simulated human emotions and humour while continuing to acknowledge their expendability.[37] Simulated reality[edit] Main article: Simulation hypothesis Simulated reality has become a common theme in science fiction, as seen in the 1999 film The Matrix, which depicts a world where artificially intelligent robots enslave humanity within a simulation which is set in the contemporary world.[38] Reception[edit] Implausibility[edit] Engineers and scientists have taken an interest in the way AI is presented in fiction. In films like the 2014 Ex Machina or 2015 Chappie, a single isolated genius becomes the first to successfully build an artificial general intelligence; scientists in the real world deem this to be unlikely. In Chappie, Transcendence, and Tron, human minds are capable of being uploaded into artificial or virtual bodies; usually no reasonable explanation is offered as to how this difficult task can be achieved. In the I, Robot and Bicentennial Man films, robots that are programmed to serve humans spontaneously generate new goals on their own, without a plausible explanation of how this took place.[39] Analysing Ian McDonald's 2004 River of Gods, Krzysztof Solarewicz identifies the ways that it depicts AIs, including "independence and unexpectedness, political awkwardness, openness to the alien and the occidental value of authenticity."[40] Another important perspective to take is that fiction's  non-rational elements in the discourse (the emotive, the mythic, or even the quasi-theological) are more than simply distortions or distractions from what might otherwise be a sober and rational public debate about the future of A.I.  Fiction can dissuade readers about future advances, causing pessimism that we see today surrounding the subject of AI.[41] Types of mention[edit] Some fictional robots such as R2-D2 have been seen as utopian, making them popular with engineers and others.[42] In 2015, All Nippon Airways unveiled this Boeing 787-9 in R2-D2 livery. The robotics researcher Omar Mubin and colleagues have analysed the engineering mentions of the top 21 fictional robots, based on those in the Carnegie Mellon University hall of fame, and the IMDb list. WALL-E had 20 mentions, followed by HAL 9000 with 15,[a] Star Wars's R2-D2 with 13, and Data with 12; the Terminator (T-800) received only 2. Of the total of 121 engineering mentions, 60 were utopian, 40 neutral, and 21 dystopian. HAL 9000 and Skynet received both utopian and dystopian mentions; for instance, HAL 9000 is seen as dystopian in one paper "because its designers failed to prioritize its goals properly",[44] but as utopian in another where a real system's "conversational chat bot interface [lacks] a HAL 9000 level of intelligence and there is ambiguity in how the computer interprets what the human is trying to convey".[45] Utopian mentions, often of WALL-E, were associated with the goal of improving communication to readers, and to a lesser extent with inspiration to authors. WALL-E was mentioned more often than any other robot for emotions (followed by HAL 9000), voice speech (followed by HAL 9000 and R2-D2), for physical gestures, and for personality. Skynet was the robot most often mentioned for intelligence, followed by HAL 9000 and Data.[42] Mubin and colleagues believed that scientists and engineers avoided dystopian mentions of robots, possibly out of "a reluctance driven by trepidation or simply a lack of awareness".[46] Portrayals of AI creators[edit] Scholars have noted that fictional creators of AI are overwhelmingly male: in the 142 most influential films featuring AI from 1920 to 2020, only 9 of 116 AI creators portrayed (8%) were female.[47] Such creators are portrayed as lone geniuses (eg, Tony Stark in the Iron Man Marvel Cinematic Universe films), associated with the military (eg, Colossus: The Forbin Project) and large corporations (eg, I, Robot), or making human-like AI to replace a lost loved one or serve as the ideal lover (e.g., The Stepford Wives).[47] See also[edit] Biology in fiction Darwin among the Machines Machine rule Simulated consciousness (science fiction) List of artificial intelligence films Notes[edit] ^ Mubin and colleagues noted that the orthography of robot names caused them difficulties; thus HAL 9000 was also written HAL, HAL9000, and HAL-9000, and similarly for other robots, so they believed their search was likely incomplete.[43] References[edit] ^ "Darwin among the Machines", reprinted in the Notebooks of Samuel Butler at Project Gutenberg ^ a b c Taylor, Tim; Dorin, Alan (2020).

Artists began to create AI art in the mid to late 20th century, when the discipline was founded. Throughout its history, AI has raised many philosophical concerns related to the human mind, artificial beings, and also what can be considered art in human AI collaboration. Since the 20th century, people have used AI to create art, some of which has been exhibited in museums and won awards.[1] During the AI boom of the 2020s, text-to-image models such as Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and FLUX.1 became widely available to the public, allowing users to quickly generate imagery with little effort.[2][3] Commentary about AI art in the 2020s has often focused on issues related to copyright, deception, defamation, and its impact on more traditional artists, including technological unemployment. History[edit] See also: History of artificial intelligence and Timeline of artificial intelligence Early history[edit] Maillardet's automaton drawing a picture Automated art dates back at least to the automata of ancient Greek civilization, when inventors such as Daedalus and Hero of Alexandria were described as designing machines capable of writing text, generating sounds, and playing music.[4][5] Creative automatons have flourished throughout history, such as Maillardet's automaton, created around 1800 and capable of creating multiple drawings and poems.[6] Also in the 19th century, Ada Lovelace, writes that "computing operations" could be used to generate music and poems, now referred to as "The Lovelace Effect," where a computer's behavior is viewed as creative.[7] Lovelace also discusses a concept known as "The Lovelace Objection," where she argues that a machine has "no pretensions whatever to originate anything."[8] In 1950, with the publication of Alan Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", there was a shift from defining machine intelligence in abstract terms to evaluating whether a machine can mimic human behavior and responses convincingly.[9] Shortly after, the academic discipline of artificial intelligence was founded at a research workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.[10] Since its founding, researchers in the field have explored philosophical questions about the nature of the human mind and the consequences of creating artificial beings with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity.[11] Artistic history[edit] Karl Sims' Gal pagos installation allowed visitors to evolve 3D animated formsSince the founding of AI in the 1950s, artists have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works. These works were sometimes referred to as algorithmic art,[12] computer art, digital art, or new media art.[13] One of the first significant AI art systems is AARON, developed by Harold Cohen beginning in the late 1960s at the University of California at San Diego.[14] AARON uses a symbolic rule-based approach to generate technical images in the era of GOFAI programming, and it was developed by Cohen with the goal of being able to code the act of drawing.[15] AARON was exhibited in 1972 at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.[16] From 1973 to 1975, Cohen refined AARON during a residency at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Stanford University.[17] In 2024, the Whitney Museum of American Art exhibited AI art from throughout Cohen's career, including re-created versions of his early robotic drawing machines.[17] Karl Sims has exhibited art created with artificial life since the 1980s. He received an M.S. in computer graphics from the MIT Media Lab in 1987 and was artist-in-residence from 1990 to 1996 at the supercomputer manufacturer and artificial intelligence company Thinking Machines.[18][19][20] In both 1991 and 1992, Sims won the Golden Nica award at Prix Ars Electronica for his videos using artificial evolution.[21][22][23] In 1997, Sims created the interactive artificial evolution installation Gal pagos for the NTT InterCommunication Center in Tokyo.[24] Sims received an Emmy Award in 2019 for outstanding achievement in engineering development.[25] Example of Electric Sheep by Scott DravesIn 1999, Scott Draves and a team of several engineers created and released Electric Sheep as a free software screensaver.[26] Electric Sheep is a volunteer computing project for animating and evolving fractal flames, which are distributed to networked computers which display them as a screensaver. The screensaver used AI to create an infinite animation by learning from its audience. In 2001, Draves won the Fundacion Telef nica Life 4.0 prize for Electric Sheep.[27][unreliable source?] In 2014, Stephanie Dinkins began working on Conversations with Bina48.[28] For the series, Dinkins recorded her conversations with BINA48, a social robot that resembles a middle-aged black woman.[29][30] In 2019, Dinkins won the Creative Capital award for her creation of an evolving artificial intelligence based on the "interests and culture(s) of people of color."[31] In 2015, Sougwen Chung began Mimicry (Drawing Operations Unit: Generation 1), an ongoing collaboration between the artist and a robotic arm.[32] In 2019, Chung won the Lumen Prize for her continued performances with a robotic arm that uses AI to attempt to draw in a manner similar to Chung.[33] Edmond de Belamy, created with a generative adversarial network in 2018In 2018, an auction sale of artificial intelligence art was held at Christie's in New York where the AI artwork Edmond de Belamy sold for US$432,500, which was almost 45 times higher than its estimate of US$7,000 10,000. The artwork was created by Obvious, a Paris-based collective.[34][35][36] In 2024, Japanese film generAIdoscope was released. The film was co-directed by Hirotaka Adachi, Takeshi Sone, and Hiroki Yamaguchi. All video, audio, and music in the film were created with artificial intelligence.[37] In 2025, Japanese anime television series Twins Hinahima was released. The anime was produced and animated with AI assistance during the process of cutting and conversion of photographs into anime illustrations and later retouched by art staff. Most of the remaining parts such as characters and logos were hand-drawn with various software.[38][39] Technical history[edit] Deep learning, characterized by its multi-layer structure that attempts to mimic the human brain, first came about in the 2010s and causing a significant shift in the world of AI art.[40] During the deep learning era, there are mainly these types of designs for generative art: autoregressive models, diffusion models, GANs, normalizing flows. In 2014, Ian Goodfellow and colleagues at Universit  de Montr al developed the generative adversarial network (GAN), a type of deep neural network capable of learning to mimic the statistical distribution of input data such as images. The GAN uses a "generator" to create new images and a "discriminator" to decide which created images are considered successful.[41] Unlike previous algorithmic art that followed hand-coded rules, generative adversarial networks could learn a specific aesthetic by analyzing a dataset of example images.[12] In 2015, a team at Google released DeepDream, a program that uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia.[42][43][44] The process creates deliberately over-processed images with a dream-like appearance reminiscent of a psychedelic experience.[45] Later, in 2017, a conditional GAN learned to generate 1000 image classes of ImageNet, a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research.[46][47] By conditioning the GAN on both random noise and a specific class label, this approach enhanced the quality of image synthesis for class-conditional models.[48] Autoregressive models were used for image generation, such as PixelRNN (2016), which autoregressively generates one pixel after another with a recurrent neural network.[49] Immediately after the Transformer architecture was proposed in Attention Is All You Need (2018), it was used for autoregressive generation of images, but without text conditioning.[50] The website Artbreeder, launched in 2018, uses the models StyleGAN and BigGAN[51][52] to allow users to generate and modify images such as faces, landscapes, and paintings.[53] In the 2020s, text-to-image models, which generate images based on prompts, became widely used, marking yet another shift in the creation of AI generated artworks.[2] Example of an image made with VQGAN-CLIP (NightCafe Studio)Example of an image made with Flux 1.1 Pro in Raw mode; this mode is designed to generate photorealistic images In 2021, using the influential large language generative pre-trained transformer models that are used in GPT-2 and GPT-3, OpenAI released a series of images created with the text-to-image AI model DALL-E 1.[54] It was an autoregressive generative model with essentially the same architecture as GPT-3. Along with this, later in 2021, EleutherAI released the open source VQGAN-CLIP[55] based on OpenAI's CLIP model.[56] Diffusion models, generative models used to create synthetic data based on existing data,[57] were first proposed in 2015,[58] but they only became better than GANs in early 2021.[59] Latent diffusion model was published in December 2021 and became the basis for the later Stable Diffusion (August 2022).[60] In 2022, Midjourney[61] was released, followed by Google Brain's Imagen and Parti, which were announced in May 2022, Microsoft's NUWA-Infinity,[62][2] and the source-available Stable Diffusion, which was released in August 2022.[63][64][65] DALL-E 2, a successor to DALL-E, was beta-tested and released (with the further successor DALL-E 3 being released in 2023). Stability AI has a Stable Diffusion web interface called DreamStudio,[66] plugins for Krita, Photoshop, Blender, and GIMP,[67] and the Automatic1111 web-based open source user interface.[68][69][70] Stable Diffusion's main pre-trained model is shared on the Hugging Face Hub.[71] Ideogram was released in August 2023, this model is known for its ability to generate legible text.[72][73] In 2024, Flux was released. This model can generate realistic images and was integrated into Grok, the chatbot used on X (formerly Twitter), and Le Chat, the chatbot of Mistral AI.[3][74][75][76] Flux was developed by Black Forest Labs, founded by the researchers behind Stable Diffusion.[77] Grok later switched to its own text-to-image model Aurora in December of the same year.[78] Several companies, along with their products, have also developed an AI model integrated with an image editing service. Adobe has released and integrated the AI model Firefly into Premiere Pro, Photoshop, and Illustrator.[79][80] Microsoft has also publicly announced AI image-generator features for Microsoft Paint.[81] Along with this, some examples of text-to-video models of the mid-2020s are Runway's Gen-2, Google's VideoPoet, and OpenAI's Sora, which was released in December 2024.[82][83] Tools and processes[edit] Imagery[edit] Example of a usage of ComfyUI for Stable Diffusion XL, people can adjust variables (such as CFG, seed, and sampler) needed to generate image There are many tools available to the artist when working with diffusion models. They can define both positive and negative prompts, but they are also afforded a choice in using (or omitting the use of) VAEs, LoRAs, hypernetworks, IP-adapter, and embedding/textual inversions. Artists can tweak settings like guidance scale (which balances creativity and accuracy), seed (to control randomness), and upscalers (to enhance image resolution), among others. Additional influence can be exerted during pre-inference by means of noise manipulation, while traditional post-processing techniques are frequently used post-inference. People can also train their own models. In addition, procedural "rule-based" generation of images using mathematical patterns, algorithms that simulate brush strokes and other painted effects, and deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and transformers have been developed. Several companies have released apps and websites that allow one to forego all the options mentioned entirely while solely focusing on the positive prompt. There also exist programs which transform photos into art-like images in the style of well-known sets of paintings.[84][85] There are many options, ranging from simple consumer-facing mobile apps to Jupyter notebooks and web UIs that require powerful GPUs to run effectively.[86] Additional functionalities include "textual inversion," which refers to enabling the use of user-provided concepts (like an object or a style) learned from a few images. Novel art can then be generated from the associated word(s) (the text that has been assigned to the learned, often abstract, concept)[87][88] and model extensions or fine-tuning (such as DreamBooth). Impact and applications[edit] AI has the potential for a societal transformation, which may include enabling the expansion of noncommercial niche genres (such as cyberpunk derivatives like solarpunk) by amateurs, novel entertainment, fast prototyping,[89] increasing art-making accessibility,[89] and artistic output per effort or expenses or time[89] e.g., via generating drafts, draft-definitions, and image components (inpainting). Generated images are sometimes used as sketches,[90] low-cost experiments,[91] inspiration, or illustrations of proof-of-concept-stage ideas. Additional functionalities or improvements may also relate to post-generation manual editing (i.e., polishing), such as subsequent tweaking with an image editor.[91] Prompt engineering and sharing[edit] See also: Prompt engineering   Text-to-image An example of prompt usage for text-to-image generation, using Fooocus Prompts for some text-to-image models can also include images and keywords and configurable parameters, such as artistic style, which is often used via keyphrases like "in the style of [name of an artist]" in the prompt[92] /or selection of a broad aesthetic/art style.[93][90] There are platforms for sharing, trading, searching, forking/refining, or collaborating on prompts for generating specific imagery from image generators.[94][95][96][97] Prompts are often shared along with images on image-sharing websites such as Reddit and AI art-dedicated websites. A prompt is not the complete input needed for the generation of an image; additional inputs that determine the generated image include the output resolution, random seed, and random sampling parameters.[98] Related terminology[edit] Synthetic media, which includes AI art, was described in 2022 as a major technology-driven trend that will affect business in the coming years.[89] Harvard Kennedy School researchers voiced concerns about synthetic media serving as a vector for political misinformation soon after studying the proliferation of AI art on the X platform.[99] Synthography is a proposed term for the practice of generating images that are similar to photographs using AI.[100] Impact[edit] Bias[edit] Further information: Algorithmic bias A major concern raised about AI-generated images and art is sampling bias within model training data leading towards discriminatory output from AI art models. In 2023, University of Washington researchers found evidence of racial bias within the Stable Diffusion model, with images of a "person" corresponding most frequently with images of males from Europe or North America.[101] Looking more into the sampling bias found within AI training data, in 2017, researchers at Princeton University used AI software to link over 2 million words, finding that European names were viewed as more "pleasant" than African-Americans names, and that the words "woman" and "girl" were more likely to be associated with the arts instead of science and math, "which were most likely connected to males."[102] Generative AI models typically work based on user-entered word-based prompts, especially in the case of diffusion models, and this word-related bias may lead to biased results. Along with this, generative AI can perpetuate harmful stereotypes regarding women. For example, Lensa, an AI app that trended on TikTok in 2023, was known to lighten black skin, make users thinner, and generate hypersexualized images of women.[103] Melissa Heikkil , a senior reporter at MIT Technology Review, shared the findings of an experiment using Lensa, noting that the generated avatars did not resemble her and often depicted her in a hypersexualized manner.[104] Experts suggest that such outcomes can result from biases in the datasets used to train AI models, which can sometimes contain imbalanced representations, including hypersexual or nude imagery.[105][106] In 2024, Google's chatbot Gemini's AI image generator was criticized for perceived racial bias, with claims that Gemini deliberately underrepresented white people in its results.[107] Users reported that it generated images of white historical figures like the Founding Fathers, Nazi soldiers, and Vikings as other races, and that it refused to process prompts such as "happy white people" and "ideal nuclear family".[107][108] Google later apologized for "missing the mark" and took Gemini's image generator offline for updates.[109] This prompted discussions about the ethical implications[110] of representing historical figures through a contemporary lens, leading critics to argue that these outputs could mislead audiences regarding actual historical contexts.[111] In addition to the well-documented representational issues such as racial and gender bias, some scholars have also pointed out deeper conceptual assumptions that shape how we perceive AI-generated art. For instance, framing AI strictly as a passive tool overlooks how cultural and technological factors influence its outputs. Others suggest viewing AI as part of a collaborative creative process, where both human and machine contribute to the artistic result.[112] Copyright[edit] Further information: Artificial intelligence and copyright Legal scholars, artists, and media corporations have considered the legal and ethical implications of artificial intelligence art since the 20th century. Some artists use AI art to critique and explore the ethics of using gathered data to produce new artwork.[113] In 1985, intellectual property law professor Pamela Samuelson argued that US copyright should allocate algorithmically generated artworks to the user of the computer program.[114] A 2019 Florida Law Review article presented three perspectives on the issue. In the first, artificial intelligence itself would become the copyright owner; to do this, Section 101 of the US Copyright Act would need to be amended to define "author" as a computer. In the second, following Samuelson's argument, the user, programmer, or artificial intelligence company would be the copyright owner. This would be an expansion of the "work for hire" doctrine, under which ownership of a copyright is transferred to the "employer." In the third situation, copyright assignments would never take place, and such works would be in the public domain, as copyright assignments require an act of authorship.[115] In 2022, coinciding with the rising availability of consumer-grade AI image generation services, popular discussion renewed over the legality and ethics of AI-generated art. A particular topic is the inclusion of copyrighted artwork and images in AI training datasets, with artists objecting to commercial AI products using their works without consent, credit, or financial compensation.[116] In September 2022, Reema Selhi, of the Design and Artists Copyright Society, stated that "there are no safeguards for artists to be able to identify works in databases that are being used and opt out."[117] Some have claimed that images generated with these models can bear resemblance to extant artwork, sometimes including the remains of the original artist's signature.[117][118] In December 2022, users of the portfolio platform ArtStation staged an online protest against non-consensual use of their artwork within datasets; this resulted in opt-out services, such as "Have I Been Trained?" increasing in profile, as well as some online art platforms promising to offer their own opt-out options.[119] According to the US Copyright Office, artificial intelligence programs are unable to hold copyright,[120][121][122] a decision upheld at the Federal District level as of August 2023 followed the reasoning from the monkey selfie copyright dispute.[123] OpenAI, the developer of DALL-E, has its own policy on who owns generated art. They assign the right and title of a generated image to the creator, meaning the user who inputted the prompt owns the image generated, along with the right to sell, reprint, and merchandise it.[124] In January 2023, three artists Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt, claiming that it is legally required to obtain the consent of artists before training neural nets on their work and that these companies infringed on the rights of millions of artists by doing so on five billion images scraped from the web.[125] In July 2023, U.S. District Judge William Orrick was inclined to dismiss most of the lawsuits filed by Andersen, McKernan, and Ortiz, but allowed them to file a new complaint.[126] Also in 2023, Stability AI was sued by Getty Images for using its images in the training data.[127] A tool built by Simon Willison allowed people to search 0.5% of the training data for Stable Diffusion V1.1, i.e., 12 million of the 2.3 billion instances from LAION 2B. Artist Karen Hallion discovered that her copyrighted images were used as training data without their consent.[128] In March 2024, Tennessee enacted the ELVIS Act, which prohibits the use of AI to mimic a musician's voice without permission.[129] A month later in that year, Adam Schiff introduced the Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act which, if passed, would require that AI companies to submit copyrighted works in their datasets to the Register of Copyrights before releasing new generative AI systems.[130] In November 2024, a group of artists and activists shared early access to OpenAI s unreleased video generation model, Sora, via Huggingface. The action, accompanied by a statement, criticized the exploitative use of artists  work by major corporations.'[131][132][133] Deception[edit] As with other types of photo manipulation since the early 19th century, some people in the early 21st century have been concerned that AI could be used to create content that is misleading and can be made to damage a person's reputation, such as deepfakes.[134] Artist Sarah Andersen, who previously had her art copied and edited to depict Neo-Nazi beliefs, stated that the spread of hate speech online can be worsened by the use of image generators.[128] Some also generate images or videos for the purpose of catfishing. AI systems have the ability to create deepfake content, which is often viewed as harmful and offensive. The creation of deepfakes poses a risk to individuals who have not consented to it.[135] This mainly refers to deepfake pornography which is used as revenge porn, where sexually explicit material is disseminated to humiliate or harm another person. AI-generated child pornography has been deemed a potential danger to society due to its unlawful nature.[136] Pseudomnesia: The Electrician won Boris Eldagsen one of the categories in the Sony World Photography Awards competition. A 2023 AI-generated image of Pope Francis wearing a puffy winter jacket fooled some viewers into believing it was an actual photograph. It went viral on social media platforms. Journalist Eliot Higgins' Midjourney-generated image depicts former President Donald Trump getting arrested. The image was posted on Twitter and went viral.[137] One of the seven AI-generated images that were used for figures in the now-retracted paper Cellular functions of spermatogonial stem cells in relation to JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Figure 1, "Spermatogonial stem cells, isolated, purified and cultured from rat testes". After winning the 2023 "Creative" "Open competition" Sony World Photography Awards, Boris Eldagsen stated that his entry was actually created with artificial intelligence. Photographer Feroz Khan commented to the BBC that Eldagsen had "clearly shown that even experienced photographers and art experts can be fooled".[138] Smaller contests have been affected as well; in 2023, a contest run by author Mark Lawrence as Self-Published Fantasy Blog-Off was cancelled after the winning entry was allegedly exposed to be a collage of images generated with Midjourney.[139] In May 2023, on social media sites such as Reddit and Twitter, attention was given to a Midjourney-generated image of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat.[140][141] Additionally, an AI-generated image of an attack on the Pentagon went viral as part of a hoax news story on Twitter.[142][143] In the days before March 2023 indictment of Donald Trump as part of the Stormy Daniels Donald Trump scandal, several AI-generated images allegedly depicting Trump's arrest went viral online.[144][145] On March 20, British journalist Eliot Higgins generated various images of Donald Trump being arrested or imprisoned using Midjourney v5 and posted them on Twitter; two images of Trump struggling against arresting officers went viral under the mistaken impression that they were genuine, accruing more than 5 million views in three days.[146][147] According to Higgins, the images were not meant to mislead, but he was banned from using Midjourney services as a result. As of April 2024, the tweet had garnered more than 6.8 million views. In February 2024, the paper Cellular functions of spermatogonial stem cells in relation to JAK/STAT signaling pathway was published using AI-generated images. It was later retracted from Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology because the paper "does not meet the standards".[148] To mitigate some deceptions, OpenAI developed a tool in 2024 to detect images that were generated by DALL-E 3.[149] In testing, this tool accurately identified DALL-E 3-generated images approximately 98% of the time. The tool is also fairly capable of recognizing images that have been visually modified by users post-generation.[150] Income and employment stability[edit] Further information: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment Th tre D'op ra Spatial, an image generated with Midjourney which won a digital art competition in 2022 As generative AI image software such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E continue to advance, the potential problems and concerns that these systems pose for creativity and artistry have risen.[128] In 2022, artists working in various media raised concerns about the impact that generative artificial intelligence could have on their ability to earn money, particularly if AI-based images started replacing artists working in the illustration and design industries.[151][152] In August 2022, digital artist R. J. Palmer stated that "I could easily envision a scenario where using AI, a single artist or art director could take the place of 5 10 entry level artists... I have seen a lot of self-published authors and such say how great it will be that they don t have to hire an artist."[118] Scholars Jiang et al. state that "Leaders of companies like Open AI and Stability AI have openly stated that they expect generative AI systems to replace creatives imminently."[128] A 2022 case study found that AI-produced images created by technology like DALL-E caused some traditional artists to be concerned about losing work, while others use it to their advantage and view it as a tool.[135] AI-based images have become more commonplace in art markets and search engines because AI-based text-to-image systems are trained from pre-existing artistic images, sometimes without the original artist's consent, allowing the software to mimic specific artists' styles.[128][153] For example, Polish digital artist Greg Rutkowski has stated that it is more difficult to search for his work online because many of the images in the results are AI-generated specifically to mimic his style.[64] Furthermore, some training databases on which AI systems are based are not accessible to the public. The ability of AI-based art software to mimic or forge artistic style also raises concerns of malice or greed.[128][154][155] Works of AI-generated art, such as Th tre D'op ra Spatial, a text-to-image AI illustration that won the grand prize in the August 2022 digital art competition at the Colorado State Fair, have begun to overwhelm art contests and other submission forums meant for small artists.[128][154][155] The Netflix short film The Dog & the Boy, released in January 2023, received backlash online for its use of artificial intelligence art to create the film's background artwork.[156] Within the same vein, Disney released Secret Invasion, a Marvel TV show with an AI-generated intro, on Disney+ in 2023, causing concern and backlash regarding the idea that artists could be made obsolete by machine-learning tools.[157] AI generated art used at the entrance of a school AI art has sometimes been deemed to be able to replace traditional stock images.[158] In 2023, Shutterstock announced a beta test of an AI tool that can regenerate partial content of other Shutterstock's images. Getty Images and Nvidia have partnered with the launch of Generative AI by iStock, a model trained on Getty's library and iStock's photo library using Nvidia's Picasso model.[159] Power usage[edit] In this 1923 comic, H. T. Webster humorously imagines the life of a cartoonist in 2023, when machines powered by electricity can produce and execute ideas for cartoons. Researchers from Hugging Face and Carnegie Mellon University reported in a 2023 paper that generating one thousand 1024 1024 images using Stable Diffusion's XL 1.0 base model requires 11.49 kWh of energy and generates 1,594 grams (56.2 oz) of carbon dioxide, which is roughly equivalent to driving an average gas-powered car a distance of 4.1 miles (6.6 km). Comparing 88 different models, the paper concluded that image-generation models used on average around 2.9 kWh of energy per 1,000 inferences.[160] Analysis of existing art using AI[edit] In addition to the creation of original art, research methods that use AI have been generated to quantitatively analyze digital art collections. This has been made possible due to the large-scale digitization of artwork in the past few decades. According to CETINIC and SHE (2022), using artificial intelligence to analyze already-existing art collections can provide new perspectives on the development of artistic styles and the identification of artistic influences.[161][162] Two computational methods, close reading and distant viewing, are the typical approaches used to analyze digitized art.[163] Close reading focuses on specific visual aspects of one piece. Some tasks performed by machines in close reading methods include computational artist authentication and analysis of brushstrokes or texture properties. In contrast, through distant viewing methods, the similarity across an entire collection for a specific feature can be statistically visualized. Common tasks relating to this method include automatic classification, object detection, multimodal tasks, knowledge discovery in art history, and computational aesthetics.[162] Synthetic images can also be used to train AI algorithms for art authentication and to detect forgeries.[164] Researchers have also introduced models that predict emotional responses to art. One such model is ArtEmis, a large-scale dataset paired with machine learning models. ArtEmis includes emotional annotations from over 6,500 participants along with textual explanations. By analyzing both visual inputs and the accompanying text descriptions from this dataset, ArtEmis enables the generation of nuanced emotional predictions.[165][166] Other forms of art[edit] AI has also been used in arts outside of visual arts. Generative AI has been used in video game production beyond imagery, especially for level design (e.g., for custom maps) and creating new content (e.g., quests or dialogue) or interactive stories in video games.[167][168] AI has also been used in the literary arts,[169] such as helping with writer's block, inspiration, or rewriting segments.[170][171][172][173] In the culinary arts, some prototype cooking robots can dynamically taste, which can assist chefs in analyzing the content and flavor of dishes during the cooking process.[174] See also[edit] Algorithmic art AI slop Applications of artificial intelligence   Art Artificial intelligence and elections   Use and impact of AI on political elections Artificial intelligence in architecture Computational creativity Cybernetic art Deepfakes Generative art List of artificial intelligence artists Music and artificial intelligence Neural style transfer Synthetic media References[edit] ^ Todorovic, Milos (2024).

The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since their development in the 1940s, digital computers have been programmed to carry out very complex tasks such as discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess with great proficiency. Despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match full human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in executing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, voice or handwriting recognition, and chatbots. What is intelligence? What do you think?Is Artificial Intelligence Good for Society?Explore the ProCon debate All but the simplest human behavior is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated insect behavior is usually not taken as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behavior of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp s instinctual behavior is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced. Intelligence conspicuously absent in the case of the wasp must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances. Psychologists generally characterize human intelligence not by just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities. Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and using language. Learning There are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence. The simplest is learning by trial and error. For example, a simple computer program for solving mate-in-one chess problems might try moves at random until mate is found. The program might then store the solution with the position so that, the next time the computer encountered the same position, it would recall the solution. This simple memorizing of individual items and procedures known as rote learning is relatively easy to implement on a computer. More challenging is the problem of implementing what is called generalization. Generalization involves applying past experience to analogous new situations. For example, a program that learns the past tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to produce the past tense of a word such as jump unless the program was previously presented with jumped, whereas a program that is able to generalize can learn the  add -ed  rule for regular verbs ending in a consonant and so form the past tense of jump on the basis of experience with similar verbs.

All of the above are varieties of data analysis.[8] Data integration is a precursor to data analysis, and data analysis is closely linked to data visualization and data dissemination.[9] Data analysis process[edit] Data science process flowchart from Doing Data Science, by Schutt & O'Neil (2013) Analysis refers to dividing a whole into its separate components for individual examination.[10] Data analysis is a process for obtaining raw data, and subsequently converting it into information useful for decision-making by users.[1] Data is collected and analyzed to answer questions, test hypotheses, or disprove theories.[11] Statistician John Tukey, defined data analysis in 1961, as:"Procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data."[12]There are several phases that can be distinguished, described below. The phases are iterative, in that feedback from later phases may result in additional work in earlier phases.[13] The CRISP framework, used in data mining, has similar steps. Data requirements[edit] The data is necessary as inputs to the analysis, which is specified based upon the requirements of those directing the analytics (or customers, who will use the finished product of the analysis).[14][15] The general type of entity upon which the data will be collected is referred to as an experimental unit (e.g., a person or population of people). Specific variables regarding a population (e.g., age and income) may be specified and obtained. Data may be numerical or categorical (i.e., a text label for numbers).[13] Data collection[edit] Data is collected from a variety of sources.[16][17] A list of data sources are available for study & research. The requirements may be communicated by analysts to custodians of the data; such as, Information Technology personnel within an organization.[18] Data collection or data gathering is the process of gathering and measuring information on targeted variables in an established system, which then enables one to answer relevant questions and evaluate outcomes. The data may also be collected from sensors in the environment, including traffic cameras, satellites, recording devices, etc. It may also be obtained through interviews, downloads from online sources, or reading documentation.[13] Data processing[edit] The phases of the intelligence cycle used to convert raw information into actionable intelligence or knowledge are conceptually similar to the phases in data analysis. Data, when initially obtained, must be processed or organized for analysis.[19] For instance, these may involve placing data into rows and columns in a table format (known as structured data) for further analysis, often through the use of spreadsheet(excel) or statistical software.[13] Data cleaning[edit] Main article: Data cleansing Once processed and organized, the data may be incomplete, contain duplicates, or contain errors.[20][21] The need for data cleaning will arise from problems in the way that the datum is entered and stored.[20] Data cleaning is the process of preventing and correcting these errors. Common tasks include record matching, identifying inaccuracy of data, overall quality of existing data, deduplication, and column segmentation.[22] Such data problems can also be identified through a variety of analytical techniques. For example; with financial information, the totals for particular variables may be compared against separately published numbers that are believed to be reliable.[23][24] Unusual amounts, above or below predetermined thresholds, may also be reviewed. There are several types of data cleaning, that are dependent upon the type of data in the set; this could be phone numbers, email addresses, employers, or other values.[25][26] Quantitative data methods for outlier detection, can be used to get rid of data that appears to have a higher likelihood of being input incorrectly.[27] Textual data spell checkers can be used to lessen the amount of mistyped words. However, it is harder to tell if the words themselves are correct.[28] Exploratory data analysis[edit] Once the datasets are cleaned, they can then be analyzed. Analysts may apply a variety of techniques, referred to as exploratory data analysis, to begin understanding the messages contained within the obtained data.[29] The process of data exploration may result in additional data cleaning or additional requests for data; thus, the initialization of the iterative phases mentioned in the lead paragraph of this section.[30] Descriptive statistics, such as, the average or median, can be generated to aid in understanding the data.[31][32] Data visualization is also a technique used, in which the analyst is able to examine the data in a graphical format in order to obtain additional insights, regarding the messages within the data.[13] Modeling and algorithms[edit] Mathematical formulas or models (also known as algorithms), may be applied to the data in order to identify relationships among the variables; for example, using correlation or causation.[33][34] In general terms, models may be developed to evaluate a specific variable based on other variable(s) contained within the dataset, with some residual error depending on the implemented model's accuracy (e.g., Data = Model + Error).[35][11] Inferential statistics includes utilizing techniques that measure the relationships between particular variables.[36] For example, regression analysis may be used to model whether a change in advertising (independent variable X), provides an explanation for the variation in sales (dependent variable Y).[37] In mathematical terms, Y (sales) is a function of X (advertising).[38] It may be described as (Y = aX + b + error), where the model is designed such that (a) and (b) minimize the error when the model predicts Y for a given range of values of X.[39] Analysts may also attempt to build models that are descriptive of the data, in an aim to simplify analysis and communicate results.[11] Data product[edit] A data product is a computer application that takes data inputs and generates outputs, feeding them back into the environment.[40] It may be based on a model or algorithm. For instance, an application that analyzes data about customer purchase history, and uses the results to recommend other purchases the customer might enjoy.[41][13] Communication[edit] Data visualization is used to help understand the results after data is analyzed.[42] Main article: Data and information visualization Once data is analyzed, it may be reported in many formats to the users of the analysis to support their requirements.[43] The users may have feedback, which results in additional analysis. As such, much of the analytical cycle is iterative.[13] When determining how to communicate the results, the analyst may consider implementing a variety of data visualization techniques to help communicate the message more clearly and efficiently to the audience.[44] Data visualization uses information displays (graphics such as, tables and charts) to help communicate key messages contained in the data.[45] Tables are a valuable tool by enabling the ability of a user to query and focus on specific numbers; while charts (e.g., bar charts or line charts), may help explain the quantitative messages contained in the data.[46] Quantitative messages[edit] Main article: Data and information visualization A time series illustrated with a line chart demonstrating trends in U.S. federal spending and revenue over time. A scatterplot illustrating the correlation between two variables (inflation and unemployment) measured at points in time. Stephen Few described eight types of quantitative messages that users may attempt to understand or communicate from a set of data and the associated graphs used to help communicate the message.[47] Customers specifying requirements and analysts performing the data analysis may consider these messages during the course of the process.[48] Time-series: A single variable is captured over a period of time, such as the unemployment rate over a 10-year period. A line chart may be used to demonstrate the trend.[49] Ranking: Categorical subdivisions are ranked in ascending or descending order, such as a ranking of sales performance (the measure) by salespersons (the category, with each salesperson a categorical subdivision) during a single period.[50] A bar chart may be used to show the comparison across the salespersons.[51] Part-to-whole: Categorical subdivisions are measured as a ratio to the whole (i.e., a percentage out of 100%). A pie chart or bar chart can show the comparison of ratios, such as the market share represented by competitors in a market.[52] Deviation: Categorical subdivisions are compared against a reference, such as a comparison of actual vs. budget expenses for several departments of a business for a given time period. A bar chart can show the comparison of the actual versus the reference amount.[53] Frequency distribution: Shows the number of observations of a particular variable for a given interval, such as the number of years in which the stock market return is between intervals such as 0 10%, 11 20%, etc. A histogram, a type of bar chart, may be used for this analysis.[54] Correlation: Comparison between observations represented by two variables (X,Y) to determine if they tend to move in the same or opposite directions. For example, plotting unemployment (X) and inflation (Y) for a sample of months. A scatter plot is typically used for this message.[55] Nominal comparison: Comparing categorical subdivisions in no particular order, such as the sales volume by product code. A bar chart may be used for this comparison.[56] Geographic or geospatial: Comparison of a variable across a map or layout, such as the unemployment rate by state or the number of persons on the various floors of a building. A cartogram is a typical graphic used.[57][58] Analyzing quantitative data[edit] See also: Problem solving Author Jonathan Koomey has recommended a series of best practices for understanding quantitative data. These include: Check raw data for anomalies prior to performing an analysis; Re-perform important calculations, such as verifying columns of data that are formula-driven; Confirm main totals are the sum of subtotals; Check relationships between numbers that should be related in a predictable way, such as ratios over time; Normalize numbers to make comparisons easier, such as analyzing amounts per person or relative to GDP or as an index value relative to a base year; Break problems into component parts by analyzing factors that led to the results, such as DuPont analysis of return on equity.[24] For the variables under examination, analysts typically obtain descriptive statistics for them, such as the mean (average), median, and standard deviation.[59] They may also analyze the distribution of the key variables to see how the individual values cluster around the mean.[60] An illustration of the MECE principle used for data analysis. The consultants at McKinsey and Company named a technique for breaking a quantitative problem down into its component parts called the MECE principle.[61] Each layer can be broken down into its components; each of the sub-components must be mutually exclusive of each other and collectively add up to the layer above them.[62] The relationship is referred to as "Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive" or MECE. For example, profit by definition can be broken down into total revenue and total cost.[63] Analysts may use robust statistical measurements to solve certain analytical problems.[64] Hypothesis testing is used when a particular hypothesis about the true state of affairs is made by the analyst and data is gathered to determine whether that state of affairs is true or false.[65][66] For example, the hypothesis might be that "Unemployment has no effect on inflation", which relates to an economics concept called the Phillips Curve.[67] Hypothesis testing involves considering the likelihood of Type I and type II errors, which relate to whether the data supports accepting or rejecting the hypothesis.[68][69] Regression analysis may be used when the analyst is trying to determine the extent to which independent variable X affects dependent variable Y (e.g., "To what extent do changes in the unemployment rate (X) affect the inflation rate (Y)?").[70] This is an attempt to model or fit an equation line or curve to the data, such that Y is a function of X.[71][72] Necessary condition analysis (NCA) may be used when the analyst is trying to determine the extent to which independent variable X allows variable Y (e.g., "To what extent is a certain unemployment rate (X) necessary for a certain inflation rate (Y)?").[70] Whereas (multiple) regression analysis uses additive logic where each X-variable can produce the outcome and the X's can compensate for each other (they are sufficient but not necessary),[73] necessary condition analysis (NCA) uses necessity logic, where one or more X-variables allow the outcome to exist, but may not produce it (they are necessary but not sufficient). Each single necessary condition must be present and compensation is not possible.[74] Analytical activities of data users[edit] Analytic activities of data visualization users Users may have particular data points of interest within a data set, as opposed to the general messaging outlined above. Such low-level user analytic activities are presented in the following table. The taxonomy can also be organized by three poles of activities: retrieving values, finding data points, and arranging data points.[75][76][77][78] # Task GeneralDescription Pro FormaAbstract Examples 1 Retrieve Value Given a set of specific cases, find attributes of those cases. What are the values of attributes {X, Y, Z, ...} in the data cases {A, B, C, ...}? - What is the mileage per gallon of the Ford Mondeo? - How long is the movie Gone with the Wind? 2 Filter Given some concrete conditions on attribute values, find data cases satisfying those conditions.

Which data cases in a set S of data cases are relevant to the current users' context? - Are there groups of restaurants that have foods based on my current caloric intake? Barriers to effective analysis[edit] Barriers to effective analysis may exist among the analysts performing the data analysis or among the audience. Distinguishing fact from opinion, cognitive biases, and innumeracy are all challenges to sound data analysis.[79] Confusing fact and opinion[edit] You are entitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts. Daniel Patrick Moynihan Effective analysis requires obtaining relevant facts to answer questions, support a conclusion or formal opinion, or test hypotheses.[80][81] Facts by definition are irrefutable, meaning that any person involved in the analysis should be able to agree upon them.[82] For example, in August 2010, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that extending the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 for the 2011 2020 time period would add approximately $3.3 trillion to the national debt.[83] Everyone should be able to agree that indeed this is what CBO reported; they can all examine the report. This makes it a fact. Whether persons agree or disagree with the CBO is their own opinion.[84] As another example, the auditor of a public company must arrive at a formal opinion on whether financial statements of publicly traded corporations are "fairly stated, in all material respects".[85] This requires extensive analysis of factual data and evidence to support their opinion. When making the leap from facts to opinions, there is always the possibility that the opinion is erroneous.[86] Cognitive biases[edit] There are a variety of cognitive biases that can adversely affect analysis. For example, confirmation bias is the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.[87] In addition, individuals may discredit information that does not support their views.[88] Analysts may be trained specifically to be aware of these biases and how to overcome them.[89] In his book Psychology of Intelligence Analysis, retired CIA analyst Richards Heuer wrote that analysts should clearly delineate their assumptions and chains of inference and specify the degree and source of the uncertainty involved in the conclusions.[90] He emphasized procedures to help surface and debate alternative points of view.[91] Innumeracy[edit] Effective analysts are generally adept with a variety of numerical techniques. However, audiences may not have such literacy with numbers or numeracy; they are said to be innumerate.[92] Persons communicating the data may also be attempting to mislead or misinform, deliberately using bad numerical techniques.[93] For example, whether a number is rising or falling may not be the key factor. More important may be the number relative to another number, such as the size of government revenue or spending relative to the size of the economy (GDP) or the amount of cost relative to revenue in corporate financial statements.[94] This numerical technique is referred to as normalization[24] or common-sizing. There are many such techniques employed by analysts, whether adjusting for inflation (i.e., comparing real vs. nominal data) or considering population increases, demographics, etc.[95] Analysts apply a variety of techniques to address the various quantitative messages described in the section above.[96] Analysts may also analyze data under different assumptions or scenarios. For example, when analysts perform financial statement analysis, they will often recast the financial statements under different assumptions to help arrive at an estimate of future cash flow, which they then discount to present value based on some interest rate, to determine the valuation of the company or its stock.[97][98] Similarly, the CBO analyzes the effects of various policy options on the government's revenue, outlays and deficits, creating alternative future scenarios for key measures.[99] Other topics[edit] Smart buildings[edit] A data analytics approach can be used in order to predict energy consumption in buildings.[100] The different steps of the data analysis process are carried out in order to realise smart buildings, where the building management and control operations including heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting and security are realised automatically by miming the needs of the building users and optimising resources like energy and time.[101] Analytics and business intelligence[edit] Main article: Analytics Analytics is the "extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive models, and fact-based management to drive decisions and actions." It is a subset of business intelligence, which is a set of technologies and processes that uses data to understand and analyze business performance to drive decision-making .[102] Education[edit] In education, most educators have access to a data system for the purpose of analyzing student data.[103] These data systems present data to educators in an over-the-counter data format (embedding labels, supplemental documentation, and a help system and making key package/display and content decisions) to improve the accuracy of educators' data analyses.[104] Practitioner notes[edit] This section contains rather technical explanations that may assist practitioners but are beyond the typical scope of a Wikipedia article.[105] Initial data analysis[edit] The most important distinction between the initial data analysis phase and the main analysis phase is that during initial data analysis one refrains from any analysis that is aimed at answering the original research question.[106] The initial data analysis phase is guided by the following four questions:[107] Quality of data[edit] The quality of the data should be checked as early as possible. Data quality can be assessed in several ways, using different types of analysis: frequency counts, descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median), normality (skewness, kurtosis, frequency histograms), normal imputation is needed.[108] Analysis of extreme observations: outlying observations in the data are analyzed to see if they seem to disturb the distribution.[109] Comparison and correction of differences in coding schemes: variables are compared with coding schemes of variables external to the data set, and possibly corrected if coding schemes are not comparable.[110] Test for common-method variance. The choice of analyses to assess the data quality during the initial data analysis phase depends on the analyses that will be conducted in the main analysis phase.[111] Quality of measurements[edit] The quality of the measurement instruments should only be checked during the initial data analysis phase when this is not the focus or research question of the study.[112][113] One should check whether structure of measurement instruments corresponds to structure reported in the literature. There are two ways to assess measurement quality: Confirmatory factor analysis Analysis of homogeneity (internal consistency), which gives an indication of the reliability of a measurement instrument.[114] During this analysis, one inspects the variances of the items and the scales, the Cronbach's   of the scales, and the change in the Cronbach's alpha when an item would be deleted from a scale[115] Initial transformations[edit] After assessing the quality of the data and of the measurements, one might decide to impute missing data, or to perform initial transformations of one or more variables, although this can also be done during the main analysis phase.[116] Possible transformations of variables are:[117] Square root transformation (if the distribution differs moderately from normal) Log-transformation (if the distribution differs substantially from normal) Inverse transformation (if the distribution differs severely from normal) Make categorical (ordinal / dichotomous) (if the distribution differs severely from normal, and no transformations help) Did the implementation of the study fulfill the intentions of the research design?[edit] One should check the success of the randomization procedure, for instance by checking whether background and substantive variables are equally distributed within and across groups.[118] If the study did not need or use a randomization procedure, one should check the success of the non-random sampling, for instance by checking whether all subgroups of the population of interest are represented in sample.[119]Other possible data distortions that should be checked are: dropout (this should be identified during the initial data analysis phase) Item non-response (whether this is random or not should be assessed during the initial data analysis phase) Treatment quality (using manipulation checks).[120] Characteristics of data sample[edit] In any report or article, the structure of the sample must be accurately described.[121][122] It is especially important to exactly determine the structure of the sample (and specifically the size of the subgroups) when subgroup analyses will be performed during the main analysis phase.[123]The characteristics of the data sample can be assessed by looking at: Basic statistics of important variables Scatter plots Correlations and associations Cross-tabulations[124] Final stage of the initial data analysis[edit] During the final stage, the findings of the initial data analysis are documented, and necessary, preferable, and possible corrective actions are taken.[125]Also, the original plan for the main data analyses can and should be specified in more detail or rewritten.[126] In order to do this, several decisions about the main data analyses can and should be made: In the case of non-normals: should one transform variables; make variables categorical (ordinal/dichotomous); adapt the analysis method? In the case of missing data: should one neglect or impute the missing data; which imputation technique should be used? In the case of outliers: should one use robust analysis techniques? In case items do not fit the scale: should one adapt the measurement instrument by omitting items, or rather ensure comparability with other (uses of the) measurement instrument(s)? In the case of (too) small subgroups: should one drop the hypothesis about inter-group differences, or use small sample techniques, like exact tests or bootstrapping? In case the randomization procedure seems to be defective: can and should one calculate propensity scores and include them as covariates in the main analyses?[127] Analysis[edit] Several analyses can be used during the initial data analysis phase:[128] Univariate statistics (single variable) Bivariate associations (correlations) Graphical techniques (scatter plots) It is important to take the measurement levels of the variables into account for the analyses, as special statistical techniques are available for each level:[129] Nominal and ordinal variables Frequency counts (numbers and percentages) Associations circumambulations (crosstabulations) hierarchical loglinear analysis (restricted to a maximum of 8 variables) loglinear analysis (to identify relevant/important variables and possible confounders) Exact tests or bootstrapping (in case subgroups are small) Computation of new variables Continuous variables Distribution Statistics (M, SD, variance, skewness, kurtosis) Stem-and-leaf displays Box plots Nonlinear analysis[edit] Nonlinear analysis is often necessary when the data is recorded from a nonlinear system. Nonlinear systems can exhibit complex dynamic effects including bifurcations, chaos, harmonics and subharmonics that cannot be analyzed using simple linear methods. Nonlinear data analysis is closely related to nonlinear system identification.[130] Main data analysis[edit] In the main analysis phase, analyses aimed at answering the research question are performed as well as any other relevant analysis needed to write the first draft of the research report.[131] Exploratory and confirmatory approaches[edit] In the main analysis phase, either an exploratory or confirmatory approach can be adopted. Usually the approach is decided before data is collected.[132] In an exploratory analysis no clear hypothesis is stated before analysing the data, and the data is searched for models that describe the data well.[133] In a confirmatory analysis clear hypotheses about the data are tested.[134] Exploratory data analysis should be interpreted carefully. When testing multiple models at once there is a high chance on finding at least one of them to be significant, but this can be due to a type 1 error.[135] It is important to always adjust the significance level when testing multiple models with, for example, a Bonferroni correction.[136] Also, one should not follow up an exploratory analysis with a confirmatory analysis in the same dataset.[137] An exploratory analysis is used to find ideas for a theory, but not to test that theory as well.[137] When a model is found exploratory in a dataset, then following up that analysis with a confirmatory analysis in the same dataset could simply mean that the results of the confirmatory analysis are due to the same type 1 error that resulted in the exploratory model in the first place.[137] The confirmatory analysis therefore will not be more informative than the original exploratory analysis.[138] Stability of results[edit] It is important to obtain some indication about how generalizable the results are.[139] While this is often difficult to check, one can look at the stability of the results. Are the results reliable and reproducible? There are two main ways of doing that.[140] Cross-validation. By splitting the data into multiple parts, we can check if an analysis (like a fitted model) based on one part of the data generalizes to another part of the data as well.[141] Cross-validation is generally inappropriate, though, if there are correlations within the data, e.g. with panel data.[142] Hence other methods of validation sometimes need to be used. For more on this topic, see statistical model validation.[143] Sensitivity analysis. A procedure to study the behavior of a system or model when global parameters are (systematically) varied. One way to do that is via bootstrapping.[144] Free software for data analysis[edit] Notable free software for data analysis include: DevInfo   A database system endorsed by the United Nations Development Group for monitoring and analyzing human development.[145] ELKI   Data mining framework in Java with data mining oriented visualization functions. KNIME   The Konstanz Information Miner, a user friendly and comprehensive data analytics framework. Orange   A visual programming tool featuring interactive data visualization and methods for statistical data analysis, data mining, and machine learning. Pandas   Python library for data analysis. PAW   FORTRAN/C data analysis framework developed at CERN. R   A programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics.[146] ROOT   C++ data analysis framework developed at CERN. SciPy   Python library for scientific computing. Julia   A programming language well-suited for numerical analysis and computational science. Reproducible analysis[edit] The typical data analysis workflow involves collecting data, running analyses through various scripts, creating visualizations, and writing reports. However, this workflow presents challenges, including a separation between analysis scripts and data, as well as a gap between analysis and documentation. Often, the correct order of running scripts is only described informally or resides in the data scientist's memory. The potential for losing this information creates issues for reproducibility. To address these challenges, it is essential to have analysis scripts written for automated, reproducible workflows. Additionally, dynamic documentation is crucial, providing reports that are understandable by both machines and humans, ensuring accurate representation of the analysis workflow even as scripts evolve.[147] International data analysis contests[edit] Different companies or organizations hold data analysis contests to encourage researchers to utilize their data or to solve a particular question using data analysis.[148][149] A few examples of well-known international data analysis contests are as follows:[150] Kaggle competition, which is held by Kaggle.[151] LTPP data analysis contest held by FHWA and ASCE.[152][153] See also[edit] Actuarial science Analytics Augmented Analytics Big data Business intelligence Censoring (statistics) Computational biology Computational physics Computational science Cross-industry standard process for data mining Data acquisition Data blending Data governance Data mining Data presentation architecture Data science Digital signal processing Dimensionality reduction Early case assessment Exploratory data analysis Fourier analysis Machine learning Multilinear PCA Multilinear subspace learning Multiway data analysis Nearest neighbor search Nonlinear system identification Predictive analytics Principal component analysis Qualitative research Structured data analysis (statistics) System identification Test method Text mining Unstructured data Wavelet List of big data companies List of datasets for machine-learning research References[edit] Citations[edit] ^ a b "Transforming Unstructured Data into Useful Information", Big Data, Mining, and Analytics, Auerbach Publications, pp. 227 246, 2014-03-12, doi:10.1201/b16666-14, ISBN 978-0-429-09529-0, retrieved 2021-05-29 ^ "The Multiple Facets of Correlation Functions", Data Analysis Techniques for Physical Scientists, Cambridge University Press, pp. 526 576, 2017, doi:10.1017/9781108241922.013, ISBN 978-1-108-41678-8, retrieved 2021-05-29 ^ Xia, B.

A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell beyond the formal modeling and thereby contrasts with traditional hypothesis testing, in which a model is supposed to be selected before the data is seen. Exploratory data analysis has been promoted by John Tukey since 1970 to encourage statisticians to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data collection and experiments. EDA is different from initial data analysis (IDA),[1][2] which focuses more narrowly on checking assumptions required for model fitting and hypothesis testing, and handling missing values and making transformations of variables as needed. EDA encompasses IDA. Overview[edit] Tukey defined data analysis in 1961 as: "Procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data."[3] Exploratory data analysis is a technique to analyze and investigate a dataset and summarize its main characteristics. A main advantage of EDA is providing the visualization of data after conducting analysis. Tukey's championing of EDA encouraged the development of statistical computing packages, especially S at Bell Labs.[4] The S programming language inspired the systems S-PLUS and R. This family of statistical-computing environments featured vastly improved dynamic visualization capabilities, which allowed statisticians to identify outliers, trends and patterns in data that merited further study. Tukey's EDA was related to two other developments in statistical theory: robust statistics and nonparametric statistics, both of which tried to reduce the sensitivity of statistical inferences to errors in formulating statistical models. Tukey promoted the use of five number summary of numerical data the two extremes (maximum and minimum), the median, and the quartiles because these median and quartiles, being functions of the empirical distribution are defined for all distributions, unlike the mean and standard deviation. Moreover, the quartiles and median are more robust to skewed or heavy-tailed distributions than traditional summaries (the mean and standard deviation). The packages S, S-PLUS, and R included routines using resampling statistics, such as Quenouille and Tukey's jackknife and Efron's bootstrap, which are nonparametric and robust (for many problems). Exploratory data analysis, robust statistics, nonparametric statistics, and the development of statistical programming languages facilitated statisticians' work on scientific and engineering problems. Such problems included the fabrication of semiconductors and the understanding of communications networks, both of which were of interest to Bell Labs. These statistical developments, all championed by Tukey, were designed to complement the analytic theory of testing statistical hypotheses, particularly the Laplacian tradition's emphasis on exponential families.[5] Development[edit] Data science process flowchart John W. Tukey wrote the book Exploratory Data Analysis in 1977.[6] Tukey held that too much emphasis in statistics was placed on statistical hypothesis testing (confirmatory data analysis); more emphasis needed to be placed on using data to suggest hypotheses to test. In particular, he held that confusing the two types of analyses and employing them on the same set of data can lead to systematic bias owing to the issues inherent in testing hypotheses suggested by the data. The objectives of EDA are to: Enable unexpected discoveries in the data Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments[7] Many EDA techniques have been adopted into data mining. They are also being taught to young students as a way to introduce them to statistical thinking.[8] Techniques and tools[edit] There are a number of tools that are useful for EDA, but EDA is characterized more by the attitude taken than by particular techniques.[9] Typical graphical techniques used in EDA are: Box plot Histogram Multi-vari chart Run chart Pareto chart Scatter plot (2D/3D) Stem-and-leaf plot Parallel coordinates Odds ratio Targeted projection pursuit Heat map Bar chart Horizon graph Glyph-based visualization methods such as PhenoPlot[10] and Chernoff faces Projection methods such as grand tour, guided tour and manual tour Interactive versions of these plots Dimensionality reduction: Multidimensional scaling Principal component analysis (PCA) Multilinear PCA Nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) Iconography of correlations Typical quantitative techniques are: Median polish Trimean Ordination History[edit] Many EDA ideas can be traced back to earlier authors, for example: Francis Galton emphasized order statistics and quantiles. Arthur Lyon Bowley used precursors of the stemplot and five-number summary (Bowley actually used a "seven-figure summary", including the extremes, deciles and quartiles, along with the median see his Elementary Manual of Statistics (3rd edn., 1920), p. 62[11]  he defines "the maximum and minimum, median, quartiles and two deciles" as the "seven positions"). Andrew Ehrenberg articulated a philosophy of data reduction (see his book of the same name). The Open University course Statistics in Society (MDST 242), took the above ideas and merged them with Gottfried Noether's work, which introduced statistical inference via coin-tossing and the median test. Example[edit] Findings from EDA are orthogonal to the primary analysis task. To illustrate, consider an example from Cook et al. where the analysis task is to find the variables which best predict the tip that a dining party will give to the waiter.[12] The variables available in the data collected for this task are: the tip amount, total bill, payer gender, smoking/non-smoking section, time of day, day of the week, and size of the party. The primary analysis task is approached by fitting a regression model where the tip rate is the response variable. The fitted model is (tip rate) = 0.18 - 0.01   (party size) which says that as the size of the dining party increases by one person (leading to a higher bill), the tip rate will decrease by 1%, on average. However, exploring the data reveals other interesting features not described by this model. Histogram of tip amounts where the bins cover $1 increments. The distribution of values is skewed right and unimodal, as is common in distributions of small, non-negative quantities. Histogram of tip amounts where the bins cover $0.10 increments. An interesting phenomenon is visible: peaks occur at the whole-dollar and half-dollar amounts, which is caused by customers picking round numbers as tips. This behavior is common to other types of purchases too, like gasoline. Scatterplot of tips vs. bill. Points below the line correspond to tips that are lower than expected (for that bill amount), and points above the line are higher than expected. We might expect to see a tight, positive linear association, but instead see variation that increases with tip amount. In particular, there are more points far away from the line in the lower right than in the upper left, indicating that more customers are very cheap than very generous. Scatterplot of tips vs. bill separated by payer gender and smoking section status. Smoking parties have a lot more variability in the tips that they give. Males tend to pay the (few) higher bills, and the female non-smokers tend to be very consistent tippers (with three conspicuous exceptions shown in the sample). What is learned from the plots is different from what is illustrated by the regression model, even though the experiment was not designed to investigate any of these other trends. The patterns found by exploring the data suggest hypotheses about tipping that may not have been anticipated in advance, and which could lead to interesting follow-up experiments where the hypotheses are formally stated and tested by collecting new data.

The proper choice of data organization into (C+1)-way array, and analysis techniques can reveal patterns in the underlying data undetected by other methods.[1] History[edit] The study of multiway data analysis was first formalized as the result of a conference held in 1988. The result of this conference was the first text specifically addressed to this field, Coppi and Bolasco's Multiway Data Analysis.[1] At that time, the application areas for multiway analysis included statistics, econometrics and psychometrics. In recent years, applications have expanded to include chemometrics, agriculture, social network analysis and the food industry.[2] Composition of multiway data analysis[edit] Multiway data[edit] Multiway data analysts use the term way to refer to the number sources of data variation while reserving the word mode for the methods or models used to analyze the data.[3]: xviii In this sense, we can define the various ways of data to analyze: One way data: A data point with I 0 {\displaystyle I_{0}} -dimensions, a   C I 0 {\displaystyle {\bf {a}}\in {\mathbb {C} }^{I_{0}}} is a vector or data point that is stored in a one-way array data structure. Two-way data: A collection of I 1 {\displaystyle I_{1}} data points a   C I 0 {\displaystyle {\bf {a}}\in {\mathbb {C} }^{I_{0}}} is stored in a two-way array, A   C I 0   I 1 {\displaystyle {\bf {A}}\in {\mathbb {C} }^{I_{0}\times I_{1}}} . A spreadsheet can be used to visualize such data in the case of discrete dimensions. Three-way data: A collection of data a   C I 0 {\displaystyle {\bf {a}}\in {\mathbb {C} }^{I_{0}}} that has two modes of variation is stored in a three-way array, A   C I 0   I 1   I 2 {\displaystyle {\bf {A}}\in {\mathbb {C} }^{I_{0}\times I_{1}\times I_{2}}} . Such data might represent the temperature at different locations (two-way data) sampled over different times (leading to three-way data) Four-way data, using the same spreadsheet analogy, can be represented as a file folder full of separate workbooks. Five-way data and six-way data can be represented by similarly higher levels of data aggregation. In general, a multiway data is stored in a multiway array and may be measured at different times, or in different places, using different methodologies, and may contain inconsistencies such as missing data or discrepancies in data representation. Multiway model[edit] Multiway application[edit] Multiway data analysis can be employed in various multiway applications so as to address the problem of finding hidden multilinear structure in multiway datasets. Following are examples of applications in different fields:[4] Computer vision - TensorFaces[5][6] and Human motion signatures[7] analyzes facial images and human joint angle data organizes in a multiway array. The multiway data analysis is employed to compute a set of causal factor representations.[8] Electroanalytical chemistry Neuroscience Process analysis Social network analysis/web-mining Multiway processing[edit] Multiway processing is the execution of designed and determined multiway model(s) transforming multiway data to the desirable level by addressing the specific need of particular multiway application. A typical example of data generated with a potentiometric electronic tongue illustrates relevant multiway processing.[9] See also[edit] Multilinear subspace learning References[edit] ^ a b Coppi, R.; Bolasco, S., eds.

(With Examples) | Coursera 0What Is Data Analysis? (With Examples)Written by Coursera Staff   Updated on Oct 3, 2024Data analysis is the practice of working with data to glean useful information, which can then be used to make informed decisions.Extracting meaning from data empowers us to make better decisions. And we re living in a time when we have more data than ever at our fingertips. Because of that, companies have been wisening up to the benefits of leveraging data and turning to data analysis to find insights to further business goals. The World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2023 listed data analysts and scientists as one of the most in-demand jobs, alongside AI and machine learning specialists and big data specialists [1].  In this article, you'll learn more about the data analysis process, different types of data analysis, and recommended courses to help you get started in this exciting field. Afterward, if you want to start working toward a data career by building job-relevant skills, consider enrolling in the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate, where you'll work on projects you can feature in your portfolio.What is data analysis? Data analysts use data to solve problems. As such, the data analysis process typically moves through several iterative phases. Let s take a closer look at each.Identify the business question you d like to answer. What problem is the company trying to solve? What do you need to measure, and how will you measure it?  Collect the raw data sets you ll need to help you answer the identified question. Data collection might come from internal sources, like a company s client relationship management (CRM) software, or from secondary sources, like government records or social media application programming interfaces (APIs).  Clean the data to prepare it for analysis. This often involves purging duplicate and anomalous data, reconciling inconsistencies, standardizing data structure and format, and dealing with white spaces and other syntax errors.Analyze the data. By manipulating the data using various data analysis techniques and tools, you can begin to find trends, correlations, outliers, and variations that tell a story. During this stage, you might use data mining to discover patterns within databases or data visualization software to help transform data into an easy-to-understand graphical format.Interpret the results of your analysis to see how well the data answered your original question. What recommendations can you make based on the data? What are the limitations to your conclusions?  You can complete labs and projects to feature in your portfolio with the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate.4 types of data analysis (with examples)Data can be used to answer questions and support decisions in many different ways. To identify the best way to analyze your data, it's useful to familiarize yourself with the different types of analysis most commonly used in the field. 1. Descriptive analysisDescriptive analysis tells us what happened. This type of analysis helps describe or summarize quantitative data by presenting statistics. For example, descriptive statistical analysis could show the distribution of sales across a group of employees and the average sales figure per employee.  Descriptive analysis answers the question:  what happened? 2. Diagnostic analysisIf the descriptive analysis determines the  what,  diagnostic analysis determines the  why.  Let s say a descriptive analysis shows an unusual influx of patients in a hospital. Drilling into the data further might reveal that many of these patients shared symptoms of a particular virus. This diagnostic analysis can help you determine that an infectious agent the  why led to the influx of patients.Diagnostic analysis answers the question:  why did it happen? 3. Predictive analysisSo far, we ve looked at types of analysis that examine and draw conclusions about the past. Predictive analytics uses data to form projections about the future. Using predictive analysis, you might notice that a given product has had its best sales during the months of September and October each year, leading you to predict a similar high point during the upcoming year.Predictive analysis answers the question:  what might happen in the future? 4. Prescriptive analysisPrescriptive analysis takes all the insights gathered from the first three types of analysis and uses them to form recommendations for how a company should act. Using our previous example, this type of analysis might suggest a market plan to build on the success of the high sales months and harness new growth opportunities in the slower months.  Prescriptive analysis answers the question:  what should we do about it?

Key takeaways and further reading Data analytics FAQ1. What is data analytics?Most companies are collecting loads of data all the time but, in its raw form, this data doesn t really mean anything. This is where data analytics comes in. Data analytics is the process of analyzing raw data in order to draw out meaningful, actionable insights, which are then used to inform and drive smart business decisions.A data analyst will extract raw data, organize it, and then analyze it, transforming it from incomprehensible numbers into coherent, intelligible information. Having interpreted the data, the data analyst will then pass on their findings in the form of suggestions or recommendations about what the company s next steps should be.You can think of data analytics as a form of business intelligence, used to solve specific problems and challenges within an organization. It s all about finding patterns in a dataset which can tell you something useful and relevant about a particular area of the business how certain customer groups behave, for example, or how employees engage with a particular tool.Data analytics helps you to make sense of the past and to predict future trends and behaviors; rather than basing your decisions and strategies on guesswork, you re making informed choices based on what the data is telling you.How businesses use data analyticsArmed with the insights drawn from the data, businesses and organizations are able to develop a much deeper understanding of their audience, their industry, and their company as a whole and, as a result, are much better equipped to make decisions and plan ahead.Understand better by watching? Learn more about the basics of data analytics from Will in the following video:2. What s the difference between data analytics and data science?You ll find that the terms  data science  and  data analytics  tend to be used interchangeably. However, they are two different fields and denote two distinct career paths. What s more, they each have a very different impact on the business or organization.Despite their differences, it s important to recognize that data science and data analytics work together, and both make extremely valuable contributions to business.You can learn more about the differences between a data scientist and a data analyst in our guide, but for now let s cover two key differences.Key difference 1: What they do with the dataOne key difference between data scientists and data analysts lies in what they do with the data and the outcomes they achieve.A data analyst will seek to answer specific questions or address particular challenges that have already been identified and are known to the business. To do this, they examine large datasets with the goal of identifying trends and patterns. They then  visualize  their findings in the form of charts, graphs, and dashboards. These visualizations are shared with key stakeholders and used to make informed, data-driven strategic decisions.A data scientist, on the other hand, considers what questions the business should or could be asking. They design new processes for data modeling, write algorithms, devise predictive models, and run custom analyses. For example: They might build a machine to leverage a dataset and automate certain actions based on that data and, with continuous monitoring and testing, and as new patterns and trends emerge, improve and optimize that machine wherever possible.In short: data analysts tackle and solve discrete questions about data, often on request, revealing insights that can be acted upon by other stakeholders, while data scientists build systems to automate and optimize the overall functioning of the business.Key difference 2: Tools and skillsAnother main difference lies in the tools and skills required for each role.Data analysts are typically expected to be proficient in software like Excel and, in some cases, querying and programming languages like SQL, R, SAS, and Python. Analysts need to be comfortable using such tools and languages to carry out data mining, statistical analysis, database management and reporting.Data scientists, on the other hand, might be expected to be proficient in Hadoop, Java, Python, machine learning, and object-oriented programming, together with software development, data mining, and data analysis.3. What are the different types of data analysis?Now we have a working definition of data analytics, let s explore the four main types of data analysis: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive.Descriptive analyticsDescriptive analytics is a simple, surface-level type of analysis that looks at what has happened in the past. The two main techniques used in descriptive analytics are data aggregation and data mining so, the data analyst first gathers the data and presents it in a summarized format (that s the aggregation part) and then  mines  the data to discover patterns.The data is then presented in a way that can be easily understood by a wide audience (not just data experts). It s important to note that descriptive analytics doesn t try to explain the historical data or establish cause-and-effect relationships; at this stage, it s simply a case of determining and describing the  what . Descriptive analytics draws on the concept of descriptive statistics.Diagnostic analyticsWhile descriptive analytics looks at the  what , diagnostic analytics explores the  why . When running diagnostic analytics, data analysts will first seek to identify anomalies within the data that is, anything that cannot be explained by the data in front of them. For example: If the data shows that there was a sudden drop in sales for the month of March, the data analyst will need to investigate the cause.To do this, they ll embark on what s known as the discovery phase, identifying any additional data sources that might tell them more about why such anomalies arose. Finally, the data analyst will try to uncover causal relationships for example, looking at any events that may correlate or correspond with the decrease in sales. At this stage, data analysts may use probability theory, regression analysis, filtering, and time-series data analytics.Learn more in our guide to diagnostic analytics.Predictive analyticsJust as the name suggests, predictive analytics tries to predict what is likely to happen in the future. This is where data analysts start to come up with actionable, data-driven insights that the company can use to inform their next steps.Predictive analytics estimates the likelihood of a future outcome based on historical data and probability theory, and while it can never be completely accurate, it does eliminate much of the guesswork from key business decisions.Predictive analytics can be used to forecast all sorts of outcomes from what products will be most popular at a certain time, to how much the company revenue is likely to increase or decrease in a given period. Ultimately, predictive analytics is used to increase the business s chances of  hitting the mark  and taking the most appropriate action.Learn more about this in our full guide to predictive analytics.Prescriptive analyticsBuilding on predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics advises on the actions and decisions that should be taken.In other words, prescriptive analytics shows you how you can take advantage of the outcomes that have been predicted. When conducting prescriptive analysis, data analysts will consider a range of possible scenarios and assess the different actions the company might take.Prescriptive analytics is one of the more complex types of analysis, and may involve working with algorithms, machine learning, and computational modeling procedures. However, the effective use of prescriptive analytics can have a huge impact on the company s decision-making process and, ultimately, on the bottom line.The type of analysis you carry out will also depend on the kind of data you re working with. If you re not already familiar, it s worth learning about the four levels of data measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.4. What are some real-world data analytics examples?Let s now take a closer look at data analytics in action with some real-world case studies.Data analytics case study: HealthcareOne area where data analytics is having a huge impact is the healthcare sector. Junbo Son, a researcher from the University of Delaware, has devised a system which helps asthma patients to better self-manage their condition using bluetooth-enabled inhalers and a special data analytics algorithm.So how does it work? First, the data is collected through a Bluetooth sensor which the user attaches to their asthma inhaler. Every time the patient uses their inhaler, the sensor transmits this usage data to their smartphone. This data is then sent to a server via a secure wireless network, where it goes through the specially devised Smart Asthma Management (SAM) algorithm.Over time, this unique algorithm helps to paint a picture of each individual patient, giving valuable insight into patient demographics, unique patient behaviours such as when they tend to exercise and how this impacts their inhaler usage as well as each patient s sensitivity to environmental asthma triggers. This is especially useful when it comes to detecting dangerous increases in inhaler usage; the data-driven SAM system can identify such increases much more quickly than the patient would be able to.What s more, the SAM system has been found to outperform traditional models, with a false alarm rate that is 10-20% lower than that of current models, together with a 40-50% lower misdetection rate.This case study highlights what a difference data analytics can make when it comes to providing effective, personalized healthcare. By collecting and analyzing the right data, healthcare professionals are able to offer support that is tailored to both the individual needs of each patient and the unique characteristics of different health conditions an approach that could be life-changing and potentially life-saving.You can learn more about this case study in the following journal article: A Data Analytics Framework for Smart Asthma Management Based on Remote Health Information Systems with Bluetooth-Enabled Personal Inhalers.Data analytics case study: NetflixAnother real-world example of data analytics in action is one you re probably already familiar with: the personalized viewing recommendations provided by Netflix. So how does Netflix make these recommendations, and what impact does this feature have on the success of the business?As you might have guessed, it all starts with data collection. Netflix collects all kinds of data from its 163 million global subscribers including what users watch and when, what device they use, whether they pause a show and resume it, how they rate certain content, and exactly what they search for when looking for something new to watch.With the help of data analytics, Netflix are then able to connect all of these individual data points to create a detailed viewing profile for each user. Based on key trends and patterns within each user s viewing behavior, the recommendation algorithm makes personalized (and pretty spot-on) suggestions as to what the user might like to watch next.This kind of personalized service has a major impact on the user experience; according to Netflix, over 75% of viewer activity is based on personalized recommendations. This powerful use of data analytics also contributes significantly to the success of the business; if you look at their revenue and usage statistics, you ll see that Netflix consistently dominates the global streaming market and that they re growing year upon year.As you can see from these two case studies alone, data analytics can be extremely powerful. For more real-world case studies, check out these five examples of how brands are using data analytics including how Coca Cola uses data analytics to drive customer retention, and how PepsiCo uses their huge volumes of data to ensure efficient supply chain management.5. What does a data analyst do?If you re considering a career as a data analyst (or thinking about hiring one for your organization), you might be wondering what tasks and responsibilities fall under the data analyst job title.You can find out the full range of things they get up to in our dedicated guide to what a data analyst does, but for now let s briefly learn by hearing from a professional and by looking at job ads.In an interview discussing what it s actually like to work as a data analyst, Radi, a data analyst at CENTOGENE, describes the role as follows: I like to think of a data analyst as a  translator . It s someone who is capable of translating numbers into plain English in order for a company to improve their business. Personally, my role as a data analyst involves collecting, processing, and performing statistical data analysis to help my company improve their product. Examining real-life data analyst job adsA job ad for a Graduate Data Analyst posted by Pareto Law describes the position as  a unique opportunity to work across all verticals as a knowledge broker, acting as an intermediary between clients and experts, connecting customers with the organization. In their ad for a Data Analyst, Shaw Media writes:  This role will primarily focus on turning datasets into an actionable direction for our newsrooms. You will be responsible for more than just monitoring our analytics it s communicating with the newsroom about what is working, what is not working, updating our dashboards, identifying trends and making sure we re on top of data privacy. Tasks and responsibilitiesAs you can see, the role of the data analyst means different things to different companies. However, there are some common threads that you ll find among most data analyst job descriptions. Based on real job ads, here are some of the typical tasks and responsibilities of a data analyst: Manage the delivery of user satisfaction surveys and report on results using data visualization software Work with business line owners to develop requirements, define success metrics, manage and execute analytical projects, and evaluate results Monitor practices, processes, and systems to identify opportunities for improvement Proactively communicate and collaborate with stakeholders, business units, technical teams and support teams to define concepts and analyze needs and functional requirements Translate important questions into concrete analytical tasks Gather new data to answer client questions, collating and organizing data from multiple sources Apply analytical techniques and tools to extract and present new insights to clients using reports and/or interactive dashboards Relay complex concepts and data into visualizations Collaborate with data scientists and other team members to find the best product solutions Design, build, test and maintain backend code Establish data processes, define data quality criteria, and implement data quality processes Take ownership of the codebase, including suggestions for improvements and refactoring Build data validation models and tools to ensure data being recorded is accurate Work as part of a team to evaluate and analyze key data that will be used to shape future business strategiesTo learn more about the kinds of tasks you can expect to take on as a data analyst, it s worth browsing job ads across a range of different industries. Search for  data analyst  on sites like Indeed, LinkedIn, and icrunchdata.com and you ll soon get a feel for what the role entails.Related reading: Why become a data analyst?6. What is the typical process that a data analyst will follow?Now we ve set the scene in terms of the overall data analyst role, let s drill down to the actual process of data analysis. Here, we ll outline the five main steps that a data analyst will follow when tackling a new project:Step 1: Define the question(s) you want to answerThe first step is to identify why you are conducting analysis and what question or challenge you hope to solve. At this stage, you ll take a clearly defined problem and come up with a relevant question or hypothesis you can test. You ll then need to identify what kinds of data you ll need and where it will come from.For example: A potential business problem might be that customers aren t subscribing to a paid membership after their free trial ends. Your research question could then be  What strategies can we use to boost customer retention? Step 2: Collect the dataWith a clear question in mind, you re ready to start collecting your data. Data analysts will usually gather structured data from primary or internal sources, such as CRM software or email marketing tools.They may also turn to secondary or external sources, such as open data sources. These include government portals, tools like Google Trends, and data published by major organizations such as UNICEF and the World Health Organization.Step 3: Clean the dataOnce you ve collected your data, you need to get it ready for analysis and this means thoroughly cleaning your dataset. Your original dataset may contain duplicates, anomalies, or missing data which could distort how the data is interpreted, so these all need to be removed. Data cleaning can be a time-consuming task, but it s crucial for obtaining accurate results.Step 4: Analyze the dataNow for the actual analysis! How you analyze the data will depend on the question you re asking and the kind of data you re working with, but some common techniques include regression analysis, cluster analysis, and time-series analysis (to name just a few).We ll go over some of these techniques in the next section. This step in the process also ties in with the four different types of analysis we looked at in section three (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive).Step 5: Visualize and share your findingsThis final step in the process is where data is transformed into valuable business insights. Depending on the type of analysis conducted, you ll present your findings in a way that others can understand in the form of a chart or graph, for example.At this stage, you ll demonstrate what the data analysis tells you in regards to your initial question or business challenge, and collaborate with key stakeholders on how to move forwards. This is also a good time to highlight any limitations to your data analysis and to consider what further analysis might be conducted.7. What tools and techniques do data analysts use?Much like web developers, data analysts rely on a range of different tools and techniques. So what are they? Let s take a look at some of the major ones:Data analytics techniquesBefore we introduce some key data analytics techniques, let s quickly distinguish between the two different types of data you might work with: quantitative and qualitative.Quantitative data is essentially anything measurable for example, the number of people who answered  yes  to a particular question on a survey, or the number of sales made in a given year. Qualitative data, on the other hand, cannot be measured, and comprises things like what people say in an interview or the text written as part of an email.Data analysts will usually work with quantitative data; however, there are some roles out there that will also require you to collect and analyze qualitative data, so it s good to have an understanding of both. With that in mind, here are some of the most common data analytics techniques:Regression analysisThis method is used to estimate or  model  the relationship between a set of variables.You might use this to see if certain variables (a movie star s number of Instagram followers and how much her last five films grossed on average) can be used to accurately predict another variable (whether or not her next film will be a big hit). Regression analysis is mainly used to make predictions.Note, however, that on their own, regressions can only be used to determine whether or not there is a relationship between a set of variables they can t tell you anything about cause and effect.Factor analysisSometimes known as dimension reduction, this technique helps data analysts to uncover the underlying variables that drive people s behavior and the choices they make.Ultimately, it condenses the data in many variables into a few  super-variables , making the data easier to work with. For example: If you have three different variables which represent customer satisfaction, you might use factor analysis to condense these variables into just one all-encompassing customer satisfaction score.Cohort analysisA cohort is a group of users who have a certain characteristic in common within a specified time period for example, all customers who purchased using a mobile device in March may be considered as one distinct cohort.In cohort analysis, customer data is broken up into smaller groups or cohorts; so, instead of treating all customer data the same, companies can see trends and patterns over time that relate to particular cohorts. In recognizing these patterns, companies are then able to offer a more targeted service.Cluster analysisThis technique is all about identifying structures within a dataset.Cluster analysis essentially segments the data into groups that are internally homogenous and externally heterogeneous in other words, the objects in one cluster must be more similar to each other than they are to the objects in other clusters.Cluster analysis enables you to see how data is distributed across a dataset where there are no existing predefined classes or groupings. In marketing, for example, cluster analysis may be used to identify distinct target groups within a larger customer base.Time-series analysisIn simple terms, time-series data is a sequence of data points which measure the same variable at different points in time.Time-series analysis, then, is the collection of data at specific intervals over a period of time in order to identify trends and cycles, enabling data analysts to make accurate forecasts for the future. If you wanted to predict the future demand for a particular product, you might use time-series analysis to see how the demand for this product typically looks at certain points in time.Other data analytics techniquesThese are just a few of the many techniques that data analysts will use, and we ve only scratched the surface in terms of what each technique involves and how it s used.Some other common techniques include: Monte Carlo simulations dispersion analysis discriminant analysis text or content analysis (a technique for analyzing qualitative data)We ve covered seven of the most useful data analysis techniques in this full guide.Data analytics toolsNow let s take a look at some of the tools that a data analyst might work with.If you re looking to become a data analyst, you ll need to be proficient in at least some of the tools listed below but, if you ve never even heard of them, don t let that deter you!

The rise in digital cyberattacks has made cybersecurity a priority for businesses and individuals. For businesses, cybercrimes can lead to financial loss, operational disruption, data breaches, and a loss of trust, while individuals face identity theft, financial fraud, and privacy invasion. Read Cyber Threat Trends Report What is cybersecurity all about? Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users through ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative. A successful cybersecurity posture has multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that one intends to keep safe. In an organization, a unified threat management gateway system can automate integrations across products and accelerate key security operations functions: detection, investigation, and remediation. People, processes, and technology must all complement one another to create an effective defense from cyberattacks. Take our free Introduction to Cybersecurity course People Users must understand and comply with basic data protection and privacy security principles like choosing strong passwords, being wary of attachments in email, and backing up data. Learn more about basic cybersecurity principles from these Top 10 Cyber Tips (PDF). Processes Organizations must have a framework for how they deal with both attempted and successful cyberattacks. One well-respected model, the NIST cybersecurity framework, can guide you. It explains how you can identify attacks, protect systems, detect and respond to threats, and recover from successful attacks. Technology Technology is essential to giving organizations and individuals the computer security tools needed to protect themselves from cyberattacks. Three main entities must be protected: endpoint devices like computers, smart devices, and routers; networks; and the cloud. Common technology used to protect these entities include next-generation firewalls, Domain Name System (DNS) filtering, malware protection, antivirus software, and email security solutions. Why is cybersecurity important? In today's connected world, everyone benefits from advanced cybersecurity solutions. At an individual level, a cybersecurity attack can result in everything from identity theft to extortion attempts, to the loss of important data like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies. Securing these and other organizations is essential to keeping our society functioning. Everyone also benefits from the work of cyberthreat researchers, like the team of 250 threat researchers at Talos, who investigate new and emerging threats and cyberattack strategies. They reveal new vulnerabilities, educate the public on the importance of cybersecurity, and strengthen open-source tools. Their work makes the internet safer for everyone.

Read e-book Hello, how can I help?Cloud computing - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Form of shared internet-based computing "Cloud Computing" redirects here and is not to be confused with Cloud Computing (horse). Cloud computing metaphor: the group of networked elements providing services does not need to be addressed or managed individually by users; instead, the entire provider-managed suite of hardware and software can be thought of as an amorphous cloud. Cloud computing is "a paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual resources with self-service provisioning and administration on-demand," according to ISO.[1] Essential characteristics In 2011, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) identified five "essential characteristics" for cloud systems.[2] Below are the exact definitions according to NIST:[2] On-demand self-service: "A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider." Broad network access: "Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations)." Resource pooling: " The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand." Rapid elasticity: "Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time." Measured service: "Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service. By 2023, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) had expanded and refined the list.[3] History Main article: History of cloud computing The history of cloud computing extends back to the 1960s, with the initial concepts of time-sharing becoming popularized via remote job entry (RJE). The "data center" model, where users submitted jobs to operators to run on mainframes, was predominantly used during this era. This was a time of exploration and experimentation with ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time-sharing, optimizing the infrastructure, platform, and applications, and increasing efficiency for end users.[4] The "cloud" metaphor for virtualized services dates to 1994, when it was used by General Magic for the universe of "places" that mobile agents in the Telescript environment could "go". The metaphor is credited to David Hoffman, a General Magic communications specialist, based on its long-standing use in networking and telecom.[5] The expression cloud computing became more widely known in 1996 when Compaq Computer Corporation drew up a business plan for future computing and the Internet. The company's ambition was to supercharge sales with "cloud computing-enabled applications". The business plan foresaw that online consumer file storage would likely be commercially successful. As a result, Compaq decided to sell server hardware to internet service providers.[6] In the 2000s, the application of cloud computing began to take shape with the establishment of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2002, which allowed developers to build applications independently. In 2006 Amazon Simple Storage Service, known as Amazon S3, and the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) were released. In 2008 NASA's development of the first open-source software for deploying private and hybrid clouds.[7][8] The following decade saw the launch of various cloud services. In 2010, Microsoft launched Microsoft Azure, and Rackspace Hosting and NASA initiated an open-source cloud-software project, OpenStack. IBM introduced the IBM SmartCloud framework in 2011, and Oracle announced the Oracle Cloud in 2012. In December 2019, Amazon launched AWS Outposts, a service that extends AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to customer data centers, co-location spaces, or on-premises facilities.[9][10] Value proposition This section cites its sources but does not provide page references.

(January 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Cloud computing can enable shorter time to market by providing pre-configured tools, scalable resources, and managed services, allowing users to focus on their core business value instead of maintaining infrastructure. Cloud platforms can enable organizations and individuals to reduce upfront capital expenditures on physical infrastructure by shifting to an operational expenditure model, where costs scale with usage. Cloud platforms also offer managed services and tools, such as artificial intelligence, data analytics, and machine learning, which might otherwise require significant in-house expertise and infrastructure investment.[11][12][13] While cloud computing can offer cost advantages through effective resource optimization, organizations often face challenges such as unused resources, inefficient configurations, and hidden costs without proper oversight and governance. Many cloud platforms provide cost management tools, such as AWS Cost Explorer and Azure Cost Management, and frameworks like FinOps have emerged to standardize financial operations in the cloud. Cloud computing also facilitates collaboration, remote work, and global service delivery by enabling secure access to data and applications from any location with an internet connection.[11][12][13] Cloud providers offer various redundancy options for core services, such as managed storage and managed databases, though redundancy configurations often vary by service tier. Advanced redundancy strategies, such as cross-region replication or failover systems, typically require explicit configuration and may incur additional costs or licensing fees.[11][12][13] Cloud environments operate under a shared responsibility model, where providers are typically responsible for infrastructure security, physical hardware, and software updates, while customers are accountable for data encryption, identity and access management (IAM), and application-level security. These responsibilities vary depending on the cloud service model Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Software as a Service (SaaS) with customers typically having more control and responsibility in IaaS environments and progressively less in PaaS and SaaS models, often trading control for convenience and managed services.[11][12][13] Factors influencing the adoption and suitability of cloud computing This section cites its sources but does not provide page references. You can help by providing page numbers for existing citations. (January 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The decision to adopt cloud computing or maintain on-premises infrastructure depends on factors such as scalability, cost structure, latency requirements, regulatory constraints, and infrastructure customization.[14][15][16][17] Organizations with variable or unpredictable workloads, limited capital for upfront investments, or a focus on rapid scalability benefit from cloud adoption. Startups, SaaS companies, and e-commerce platforms often prefer the pay-as-you-go operational expenditure (OpEx) model of cloud infrastructure. Additionally, companies prioritizing global accessibility, remote workforce enablement, disaster recovery, and leveraging advanced services such as AI/ML and analytics are well-suited for the cloud. In recent years, some cloud providers have started offering specialized services for high-performance computing and low-latency applications, addressing some use cases previously exclusive to on-premises setups.[14][15][16][17] On the other hand, organizations with strict regulatory requirements, highly predictable workloads, or reliance on deeply integrated legacy systems may find cloud infrastructure less suitable. Businesses in industries like defense, government, or those handling highly sensitive data often favor on-premises setups for greater control and data sovereignty. Additionally, companies with ultra-low latency requirements, such as high-frequency trading (HFT) firms, rely on custom hardware (e.g., FPGAs) and physical proximity to exchanges, which most cloud providers cannot fully replicate despite recent advancements. Similarly, tech giants like Google, Meta, and Amazon build their own data centers due to economies of scale, predictable workloads, and the ability to customize hardware and network infrastructure for optimal efficiency. However, these companies also use cloud services selectively for certain workloads and applications where it aligns with their operational needs.[14][15][16][17] In practice, many organizations are increasingly adopting hybrid cloud architectures, combining on-premises infrastructure with cloud services. This approach allows businesses to balance scalability, cost-effectiveness, and control, offering the benefits of both deployment models while mitigating their respective limitations.[14][15][16][17] Challenges and limitations Main article: Cloud computing issues One of the main challenges of cloud computing, in comparison to more traditional on-premises computing, is data security and privacy. Cloud users entrust their sensitive data to third-party providers, who may not have adequate measures to protect it from unauthorized access, breaches, or leaks. Cloud users also face compliance risks if they have to adhere to certain regulations or standards regarding data protection, such as GDPR or HIPAA.[18] Another challenge of cloud computing is reduced visibility and control. Cloud users may not have full insight into how their cloud resources are managed, configured, or optimized by their providers. They may also have limited ability to customize or modify their cloud services according to their specific needs or preferences.[18] Complete understanding of all technology may be impossible, especially given the scale, complexity, and deliberate opacity of contemporary systems; however, there is a need for understanding complex technologies and their interconnections to have power and agency within them.[19] The metaphor of the cloud can be seen as problematic as cloud computing retains the aura of something noumenal and numinous; it is something experienced without precisely understanding what it is or how it works.[20] Additionally, cloud migration is a significant challenge. This process involves transferring data, applications, or workloads from one cloud environment to another, or from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. Cloud migration can be complicated, time-consuming, and expensive, particularly when there are compatibility issues between different cloud platforms or architectures. If not carefully planned and executed, cloud migration can lead to downtime, reduced performance, or even data loss.[21] Cloud migration challenges According to the 2024 State of the Cloud Report by Flexera, approximately 50% of respondents identified the following top challenges when migrating workloads to public clouds:[22] "Understanding application dependencies" "Comparing on-premise and cloud costs" "Assessing technical feasibility." Implementation challenges Applications hosted in the cloud are susceptible to the fallacies of distributed computing, a series of misconceptions that can lead to significant issues in software development and deployment.[23] Cloud cost overruns In a report by Gartner, a survey of 200 IT leaders revealed that 69% experienced budget overruns in their organizations' cloud expenditures during 2023. Conversely, 31% of IT leaders whose organizations stayed within budget attributed their success to accurate forecasting and budgeting, proactive monitoring of spending, and effective optimization.[24] The 2024 Flexera State of Cloud Report identifies the top cloud challenges as managing cloud spend, followed by security concerns and lack of expertise. Public cloud expenditures exceeded budgeted amounts by an average of 15%. The report also reveals that cost savings is the top cloud initiative for 60% of respondents. Furthermore, 65% measure cloud progress through cost savings, while 42% prioritize shorter time-to-market, indicating that cloud's promise of accelerated deployment is often overshadowed by cost concerns.[22] Service Level Agreements Typically, cloud providers' Service Level Agreements (SLAs) do not encompass all forms of service interruptions. Exclusions typically include planned maintenance, downtime resulting from external factors such as network issues, human errors, like misconfigurations, natural disasters, force majeure events, or security breaches. Typically, customers bear the responsibility of monitoring SLA compliance and must file claims for any unmet SLAs within a designated timeframe. Customers should be aware of how deviations from SLAs are calculated, as these parameters may vary by service. These requirements can place a considerable burden on customers. Additionally, SLA percentages and conditions can differ across various services within the same provider, with some services lacking any SLA altogether. In cases of service interruptions due to hardware failures in the cloud provider, the company typically does not offer monetary compensation. Instead, eligible users may receive credits as outlined in the corresponding SLA.[25][26][27][28] Leaky abstractions Cloud computing abstractions aim to simplify resource management, but leaky abstractions can expose underlying complexities. These variations in abstraction quality depend on the cloud vendor, service and architecture. Mitigating leaky abstractions requires users to understand the implementation details and limitations of the cloud services they utilize.[29][30][31] Service lock-in within the same vendor Service lock-in within the same vendor occurs when a customer becomes dependent on specific services within a cloud vendor, making it challenging to switch to alternative services within the same vendor when their needs change.[32][33] Security and privacy Cloud suppliers security and privacy agreements must be aligned to the demand(s) requirements and regulations. Main article: Cloud computing security Cloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can access the data that is in the cloud at any time. It could accidentally or deliberately alter or delete information.[34] Many cloud providers can share information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order without a warrant. That is permitted in their privacy policies, which users must agree to before they start using cloud services. Solutions to privacy include policy and legislation as well as end-users' choices for how data is stored.[34] Users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access.[34] Identity management systems can also provide practical solutions to privacy concerns in cloud computing. These systems distinguish between authorized and unauthorized users and determine the amount of data that is accessible to each entity.[35] The systems work by creating and describing identities, recording activities, and getting rid of unused identities. According to the Cloud Security Alliance, the top three threats in the cloud are Insecure Interfaces and APIs, Data Loss & Leakage, and Hardware Failure which accounted for 29%, 25% and 10% of all cloud security outages respectively. Together, these form shared technology vulnerabilities. In a cloud provider platform being shared by different users, there may be a possibility that information belonging to different customers resides on the same data server. Additionally, Eugene Schultz, chief technology officer at Emagined Security, said that hackers are spending substantial time and effort looking for ways to penetrate the cloud. "There are some real Achilles' heels in the cloud infrastructure that are making big holes for the bad guys to get into". Because data from hundreds or thousands of companies can be stored on large cloud servers, hackers can theoretically gain control of huge stores of information through a single attack a process he called "hyperjacking". Some examples of this include the Dropbox security breach, and iCloud 2014 leak.[36] Dropbox had been breached in October 2014, having over seven million of its users passwords stolen by hackers in an effort to get monetary value from it by Bitcoins (BTC). By having these passwords, they are able to read private data as well as have this data be indexed by search engines (making the information public).[36] There is the problem of legal ownership of the data (If a user stores some data in the cloud, can the cloud provider profit from it?). Many Terms of Service agreements are silent on the question of ownership.[37] Physical control of the computer equipment (private cloud) is more secure than having the equipment off-site and under someone else's control (public cloud). This delivers great incentive to public cloud computing service providers to prioritize building and maintaining strong management of secure services.[38] Some small businesses that do not have expertise in IT security could find that it is more secure for them to use a public cloud. There is the risk that end users do not understand the issues involved when signing on to a cloud service (persons sometimes do not read the many pages of the terms of service agreement, and just click "Accept" without reading). This is important now that cloud computing is common and required for some services to work, for example for an intelligent personal assistant (Apple's Siri or Google Assistant). Fundamentally, private cloud is seen as more secure with higher levels of control for the owner, however public cloud is seen to be more flexible and requires less time and money investment from the user.[39] The attacks that can be made on cloud computing systems include man-in-the middle attacks, phishing attacks, authentication attacks, and malware attacks. One of the largest threats is considered to be malware attacks, such as Trojan horses. Recent research conducted in 2022 has revealed that the Trojan horse injection method is a serious problem with harmful impacts on cloud computing systems.[40] Service models See also: "as a service" Comparison of on-premise, IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS Cloud computing service models arranged as layers in a stack The National Institute of Standards and Technology recognized three cloud service models in 2011: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).[2] The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) later identified additional models in 2023, including "Network as a Service", "Communications as a Service", "Compute as a Service", and "Data Storage as a Service".[3] Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) Main article: Infrastructure as a service Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to abstract various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup, etc. A hypervisor runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements. Linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single Linux kernel running directly on the physical hardware. Linux cgroups and namespaces are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to isolate, secure and manage the containers. The use of containers offers higher performance than virtualization because there is no hypervisor overhead. IaaS clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtual-machine disk-image library, raw block storage, file or object storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks (VLANs), and software bundles.[41] Further information: CloudBioLinux The NIST's definition of cloud computing describes IaaS as "where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls)."[2] IaaS-cloud providers supply these resources on-demand from their large pools of equipment installed in data centers. For wide-area connectivity, customers can use either the Internet or carrier clouds (dedicated virtual private networks). To deploy their applications, cloud users install operating-system images and their application software on the cloud infrastructure. In this model, the cloud user patches and maintains the operating systems and the application software. Cloud providers typically bill IaaS services on a utility computing basis: cost reflects the number of resources allocated and consumed.[42] Platform as a service (PaaS) Main article: Platform as a service The NIST's definition of cloud computing defines Platform as a Service as:[2] The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment. PaaS vendors offer a development environment to application developers. The provider typically develops toolkit and standards for development and channels for distribution and payment. In the PaaS models, cloud providers deliver a computing platform, typically including an operating system, programming-language execution environment, database, and the web server. Application developers develop and run their software on a cloud platform instead of directly buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers. With some PaaS, the underlying computer and storage resources scale automatically to match application demand so that the cloud user does not have to allocate resources manually.[43][need quotation to verify] Some integration and data management providers also use specialized applications of PaaS as delivery models for data. Examples include iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service) and dPaaS (Data Platform as a Service). iPaaS enables customers to develop, execute and govern integration flows.[44] Under the iPaaS integration model, customers drive the development and deployment of integrations without installing or managing any hardware or middleware.[45] dPaaS delivers integration and data-management products as a fully managed service.[46] Under the dPaaS model, the PaaS provider, not the customer, manages the development and execution of programs by building data applications for the customer. dPaaS users access data through data-visualization tools.[47] Software as a service (SaaS) Main article: Software as a service The NIST's definition of cloud computing defines Software as a Service as:[2] The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings. In the software as a service (SaaS) model, users gain access to application software and databases. Cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms that run the applications. SaaS is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software" and is usually priced on a pay-per-use basis or using a subscription fee.[48] In the SaaS model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud and cloud users access the software from cloud clients. Cloud users do not manage the cloud infrastructure and platform where the application runs. This eliminates the need to install and run the application on the cloud user's own computers, which simplifies maintenance and support. Cloud applications differ from other applications in their scalability which can be achieved by cloning tasks onto multiple virtual machines at run-time to meet changing work demand.[49] Load balancers distribute the work over the set of virtual machines. This process is transparent to the cloud user, who sees only a single access-point. To accommodate a large number of cloud users, cloud applications can be multitenant, meaning that any machine may serve more than one cloud-user organization. The pricing model for SaaS applications is typically a monthly or yearly flat fee per user,[50] so prices become scalable and adjustable if users are added or removed at any point. It may also be free.[51] Proponents claim that SaaS gives a business the potential to reduce IT operational costs by outsourcing hardware and software maintenance and support to the cloud provider. This enables the business to reallocate IT operations costs away from hardware/software spending and from personnel expenses, towards meeting other goals. In addition, with applications hosted centrally, updates can be released without the need for users to install new software. One drawback of SaaS comes with storing the users' data on the cloud provider's server. As a result,[citation needed] there could be unauthorized access to the data.[52] Examples of applications offered as SaaS are games and productivity software like Google Docs and Office Online. SaaS applications may be integrated with cloud storage or File hosting services, which is the case with Google Docs being integrated with Google Drive, and Office Online being integrated with OneDrive.[53] Serverless computing Main article: Serverless computing Serverless computing allows customers to use various cloud capabilities without the need to provision, deploy, or manage hardware or software resources, apart from providing their application code or data. ISO/IEC 22123-2:2023 classifies serverless alongside Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) under the broader category of cloud service categories. Notably, while ISO refers to these classifications as cloud service categories, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) refers to them as service models.[2][3] Deployment models Cloud computing types "A cloud deployment model represents the way in which cloud computing can be organized based on the control and sharing of physical or virtual resources."[3] Cloud deployment models define the fundamental patterns of interaction between cloud customers and cloud providers. They do not detail implementation specifics or the configuration of resources.[3] Private Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third party, and hosted either internally or externally.[2] Undertaking a private cloud project requires significant engagement to virtualize the business environment, and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources. It can improve business, but every step in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities. Self-run data centers[54] are generally capital intensive. They have a significant physical footprint, requiring allocations of space, hardware, and environmental controls. These assets have to be refreshed periodically, resulting in additional capital expenditures. They have attracted criticism because users "still have to buy, build, and manage them" and thus do not benefit from less hands-on management,[55] essentially "[lacking] the economic model that makes cloud computing such an intriguing concept".[56][57] Public For a comparison of cloud-computing software and providers, see Cloud-computing comparison Cloud services are considered "public" when they are delivered over the public Internet, and they may be offered as a paid subscription, or free of charge.[58] Architecturally, there are few differences between public- and private-cloud services, but security concerns increase substantially when services (applications, storage, and other resources) are shared by multiple customers. Most public-cloud providers offer direct-connection services that allow customers to securely link their legacy data centers to their cloud-resident applications.[59][60] Several factors like the functionality of the solutions, cost, integrational and organizational aspects as well as safety & security are influencing the decision of enterprises and organizations to choose a public cloud or on-premises solution.[61] Hybrid See also: Hybrid cloud storage Hybrid cloud is a composition of a public cloud and a private environment, such as a private cloud or on-premises resources,[62][63] that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models. Hybrid cloud can also mean the ability to connect collocation, managed and/or dedicated services with cloud resources.[2] Gartner defines a hybrid cloud service as a cloud computing service that is composed of some combination of private, public and community cloud services, from different service providers.[64] A hybrid cloud service crosses isolation and provider boundaries so that it cannot be simply put in one category of private, public, or community cloud service. It allows one to extend either the capacity or the capability of a cloud service, by aggregation, integration or customization with another cloud service. Varied use cases for hybrid cloud composition exist. For example, an organization may store sensitive client data in house on a private cloud application, but interconnect that application to a business intelligence application provided on a public cloud as a software service.[65] This example of hybrid cloud extends the capabilities of the enterprise to deliver a specific business service through the addition of externally available public cloud services. Hybrid cloud adoption depends on a number of factors such as data security and compliance requirements, level of control needed over data, and the applications an organization uses.[66] Another example of hybrid cloud is one where IT organizations use public cloud computing resources to meet temporary capacity needs that can not be met by the private cloud.[67] This capability enables hybrid clouds to employ cloud bursting for scaling across clouds.[2] Cloud bursting is an application deployment model in which an application runs in a private cloud or data center and "bursts" to a public cloud when the demand for computing capacity increases. A primary advantage of cloud bursting and a hybrid cloud model is that an organization pays for extra compute resources only when they are needed.[68] Cloud bursting enables data centers to create an in-house IT infrastructure that supports average workloads, and use cloud resources from public or private clouds, during spikes in processing demands.[69] Community Community cloud shares infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether it is managed internally or by a third-party, and hosted internally or externally, the costs are distributed among fewer users compared to a public cloud (but more than a private cloud). As a result, only a portion of the potential cost savings of cloud computing is achieved. [2] Multi cloud Main article: Multicloud According to ISO/IEC 22123-1: "multi-cloud is a cloud deployment model in which a customer uses public cloud services provided by two or more cloud service providers". [70] Poly cloud refers to the use of multiple public clouds for the purpose of leveraging specific services that each provider offers. It differs from Multi cloud in that it is not designed to increase flexibility or mitigate against failures but is rather used to allow an organization to achieve more than could be done with a single provider.[71] Market According to International Data Corporation (IDC), global spending on cloud computing services has reached $706 billion and is expected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2025.[72] Gartner estimated that global public cloud services end-user spending would reach $600 billion by 2023.[73] According to a McKinsey & Company report, cloud cost-optimization levers and value-oriented business use cases foresee more than $1 trillion in run-rate EBITDA across Fortune 500 companies as up for grabs in 2030.[74] In 2022, more than $1.3 trillion in enterprise IT spending was at stake from the shift to the cloud, growing to almost $1.8 trillion in 2025, according to Gartner.[75] The European Commission's 2012 Communication identified several issues which were impeding the development of the cloud computing market:[76]: Section 3 fragmentation of the digital single market across the EU concerns about contracts including reservations about data access and ownership, data portability, and change control variations in standards applicable to cloud computing The Communication set out a series of "digital agenda actions" which the Commission proposed to undertake in order to support the development of a fair and effective market for cloud computing services.[76]: Pages 6 14 Cloud Computing Vendors As of 2025, the three largest cloud computing providers by market share, commonly referred to as hyperscalers, are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.[77][78] These companies dominate the global cloud market due to their extensive infrastructure, broad service offerings, and scalability. In recent years, organizations have increasingly adopted alternative cloud providers, which offer specialized services that distinguish them from hyperscalers. These providers may offer advantages such as lower costs, improved cost transparency and predictability, enhanced data sovereignty (particularly within regions such as the European Union to comply with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)), stronger alignment with local regulatory requirements, or industry-specific services.[79] Alternative cloud providers are often part of multi-cloud strategies, where organizations use multiple cloud services both from hyperscalers and specialized providers to optimize performance, compliance, and cost efficiency. However, they do not necessarily serve as direct replacements for hyperscalers, as their offerings are typically more specialized.[79] Alternative Cloud Providers Several alternative cloud providers offer specialized services that differentiate them from hyperscalers. CoreWeave   Specializes in high-performance computing and GPU-accelerated workloads, often used for AI, graphics rendering, and scientific simulations.[80][81][82] Scaleway -   A French cloud provider offering infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solutions, with a focus on GDPR compliance and regional data sovereignty.[83][84] MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed database-as-a-service (DBaaS) that allows users to deploy and operate MongoDB databases on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.[85] OVHcloud   A France-based cloud provider known for its emphasis on data sovereignty, offering private cloud, dedicated servers, and European-hosted cloud solutions. [86][87] Lambda Labs   Provides GPU cloud computing tailored for AI research, deep learning, and machine learning development.[88][89][90][91] Paperspace   Specializes in cloud computing solutions for AI and machine learning, with a focus on scalable GPU access. [92][93] RunPod   Offers cloud computing infrastructure optimized for AI applications and model deployment. [94][95][96] Similar concepts The goal of cloud computing is to allow users to take benefit from all of these technologies, without the need for deep knowledge about or expertise with each one of them. The cloud aims to cut costs and helps the users focus on their core business instead of being impeded by IT obstacles.[97] The main enabling technology for cloud computing is virtualization. Virtualization software separates a physical computing device into one or more "virtual" devices, each of which can be easily used and managed to perform computing tasks. With operating system level virtualization essentially creating a scalable system of multiple independent computing devices, idle computing resources can be allocated and used more efficiently. Virtualization provides the agility required to speed up IT operations and reduces cost by increasing infrastructure utilization. Autonomic computing automates the process through which the user can provision resources on-demand. By minimizing user involvement, automation speeds up the process, reduces labor costs and reduces the possibility of human errors.[97] Cloud computing uses concepts from utility computing to provide metrics for the services used. Cloud computing attempts to address QoS (quality of service) and reliability problems of other grid computing models.[97] Cloud computing shares characteristics with: Client server model   Client server computing refers broadly to any distributed application that distinguishes between service providers (servers) and service requestors (clients).[98] Computer bureau   A service bureau providing computer services, particularly from the 1960s to 1980s. Grid computing   A form of distributed and parallel computing, whereby a 'super and virtual computer' is composed of a cluster of networked, loosely coupled computers acting in concert to perform very large tasks. Fog computing   Distributed computing paradigm that provides data, compute, storage and application services closer to the client or near-user edge devices, such as network routers. Furthermore, fog computing handles data at the network level, on smart devices and on the end-user client-side (e.g. mobile devices), instead of sending data to a remote location for processing. Utility computing   The "packaging of computing resources, such as computation and storage, as a metered service similar to a traditional public utility, such as electricity."[99][100] Peer-to-peer   A distributed architecture without the need for central coordination. Participants are both suppliers and consumers of resources (in contrast to the traditional client-server model). Cloud sandbox   A live, isolated computer environment in which a program, code or file can run without affecting the application in which it runs.

Benefits of cloud computing Agility The cloud gives you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and build nearly anything that you can imagine. You can quickly spin up resources as you need them from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to Internet of Things, machine learning, data lakes and analytics, and much more. You can deploy technology services in a matter of minutes, and get from idea to implementation several orders of magnitude faster than before. This gives you the freedom to experiment, test new ideas to differentiate customer experiences, and transform your business.

This gives you the freedom to experiment, test new ideas to differentiate customer experiences, and transform your business. Elasticity With cloud computing, you don t have to over-provision resources up front to handle peak levels of business activity in the future. Instead, you provision the amount of resources that you actually need. You can scale these resources up or down to instantly grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change.

Instead, you provision the amount of resources that you actually need. You can scale these resources up or down to instantly grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change. Cost savings The cloud allows you to trade fixed expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it. Plus, the variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do it yourself because of the economies of scale.

Deploy globally in minutes With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes. For example, AWS has infrastructure all over the world, so you can deploy your application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks. Putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency and improves their experience.

Types of cloud computing The three main types of cloud computing include Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. Each type of cloud computing provides different levels of control, flexibility, and management so that you can select the right set of services for your needs. The three main types of cloud computing include Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. Each type of cloud computing provides different levels of control, flexibility, and management so that you can select the right set of services for your needs. Learn more Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives you the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources. It is most similar to the existing IT resources with which many IT departments and developers are familiar. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT.

IaaS gives you the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources. It is most similar to the existing IT resources with which many IT departments and developers are familiar. Platform as a Service (PaaS) PaaS removes the need for you to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.

This helps you be more efficient as you don t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. Software as a Service (SaaS) SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications (such as web-based email). With a SaaS offering, you don t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software. Software as a Service (SaaS) SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider.

Cloud services are IT resources managed by AWS and delivered on demand over the internet. Traditionally, organizations had to purchase and configure everything from server hardware and storage systems to networking and security technologies before launching any digital system. Provisioning and managing IT infrastructure is expensive, complicated; and takes time away from innovation. Cloud services allow anyone to access the IT infrastructure needed to build and maintain digital systems, abstracting complex infrastructure so anyone can build sophisticated applications quickly and scale globally. Running your applications on a cloud server is just the start. You can use cloud services to add artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), real-time data analytics, and many other capabilities to your applications. What are cloud managed services? Cloud services are also called cloud managed services because the underlying infrastructure is fully managed by AWS. All required hardware, operating systems, and other infrastructure layers are stored and managed in highly secure AWS data centers distributed around the globe. We purchase and maintain all types of IT resources, making them available as services you can access in your application code. AWS monitors and maintains cloud servers, storage, networks, databases, and more, ensuring consistent performance and uptime. Beyond hardware maintenance, we handle all types of IT operational tasks from load balancing and patch management to disaster recovery and more. Today, thanks to AWS, anyone from college students to enterprise teams can access cloud services at a fraction of the cost of managing on-premises infrastructure. Anyone can build and deploy software without heavy upfront IT infrastructure investments. What are cloud services?

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. It is used for: web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, system scripting. What can Python do? Python can be used on a server to create web applications. Python can be used alongside software to create workflows. Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files. Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics. Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development. Why Python? Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc). Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick. Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way. Good to know The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular. In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files. Python Syntax compared to other programming languages Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics. Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses. Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[33] Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[34][35] Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language, and he first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[36] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.[37] Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and it has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.[38][39][40][41] History[edit] Main article: History of Python The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at PyCon US 2024 Python was conceived in the late 1980s[42] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands; it was conceived as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[43] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[12] Python implementation began in December 1989.[44] Van Rossum assumed sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL); this title was bestowed on him by the Python community to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[45] (He has since come out of retirement and is self-titled "BDFL-emeritus".) In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[46][47] The name Python is said to derive from the British comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus.[48] Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[49] Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, and then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] It no longer receives security patches or updates.[52][53] While Python 2.7 and older versions are officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e., "2.7.18+" (plus 3.10), with the plus signifying (at least some) "backported security updates".[54] Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008, with some new semantics and changed syntax. At least every Python release since (the now unsupported) 3.5 has added some syntax to the language; a few later releases have removed outdated modules and have changed semantics, at least in a minor way. As of 8 April 2025[update], Python 3.13.3 is the latest stable release (it's highly recommended to upgrade to it, or upgrade any other older 3.x release). This version currently receives full bug-fix and security updates, while Python 3.12 released in October 2023 had active bug-fix support only until April 2025, and since then only security fixes. Python 3.9[55] is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), because Python 3.8 has become an end-of-life product.[56][57] Starting with Python 3.13, it and later versions receive two years of full support (which has increased from one and a half years), followed by three years of security support; this is the same total duration of support as previously. Security updates were expedited in 2021 and again twice in 2022. More issues were fixed in 2023 and in September 2024 (for Python versions 3.8.20 through 3.12.6) all versions (including 2.7)[58] had been insecure because of issues leading to possible remote code execution[59] and web-cache poisoning.[60] Python 3.10 added the | union type operator[61] and added structural pattern matching capability to the language, with the new match and case keywords.[62] Python 3.11 expanded exception handling functionality. Python 3.12 added the new keyword type. Notable changes from version 3.10 to 3.11 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[63] Python 3.11 is claimed to be 10 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 increases by an additional 5%. Python 3.12 also includes improved error messages (again improved in 3.14) and many other changes. Python 3.13 introduced more syntax for types; a new and improved interactive interpreter (REPL), featuring multi-line editing and color support; an incremental garbage collector, which results in shorter pauses for collection in programs that have many objects, as well as increasing the improved speed in 3.11 and 3.12); an experimental just-in-time (JIT) compiler (such features need to be enabled specifically for the increase in speed);[64] and an experimental free-threaded build mode, which disables the global interpreter lock (GIL), allowing threads to run more concurrently, as enabled inpython3.13t or python3.13t.exe. Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 711 proposes PyBI a standard format for distributing Python binaries.[65] Python 3.14.0 is now in the beta 1 phase (introduces e.g. a new opt-in interpreter, up to 30% faster). Python 3.15 will "Make UTF-8 mode default";[66] This mode is supported in all current Python versions, but it currently must be opted into. UTF-8 is already used by default on Windows (and other operating systems) for most purposes; an exception is opening files. Enabling UTF-8 also makes code fully cross-platform. Potentially breaking changes Python 3.0 introduced very breaking changes, but all breaking changes in 3.x discussed below, are designed to affect few users. Python 3.12 dropped some outdated modules, and more will be dropped in the future, deprecated as of 3.13; already deprecated array 'u' format code will emit DeprecationWarning since 3.13 and will be removed in Python 3.16. The 'w' format code should be used instead. Part of ctypes is also deprecated and http.server.CGIHTTPRequestHandler will emit a DeprecationWarning, and will be removed in 3.15. Using that code already has a high potential for both security and functionality bugs. Parts of the typing module are deprecated, e.g. creating a typing.NamedTuple class using keyword arguments to denote the fields and such (and more) will be disallowed in Python 3.15. Python 3.12 removed wstr meaning Python extensions[67] need to be modified.[68] Python 3.13 introduces some changes in behavior, i.e., new "well-defined semantics", fixing bugs, and removing many deprecated classes, functions and methods (as well as some of the Python/C API and outdated modules). "The old implementation of locals() and frame.f_locals was slow, inconsistent and buggy, and it had many corner cases and oddities. Code that works around those may need revising; code that uses locals() for simple templating or print debugging should continue to work correctly."[69] Python 3.13 introduces the experimental free-threaded build mode, which disables the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL); the GIL is a feature of CPython that previously prevented multiple threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously. This optional build, introduced through PEP 703, enables better exploitation of multi-core CPUs. By allowing multiple threads to run Python code in parallel, the free-threaded mode addresses long-standing performance bottlenecks associated with the GIL. This change offers a new path for parallelism in Python, without resorting to multiprocessing or external concurrency frameworks.[70] Regarding annotations in upcoming Python version: "In Python 3.14, from __future__ import annotations will continue to work as it did before, converting annotations into strings."[71] Python 3.14 drops the PGP digital verification signatures, it had deprecated in version 3.11, when its replacement Sigstore was added for all CPython artifacts; the use of PGP has been criticized by security practitioners.[72] Some additional standard-library modules will be removed in Python 3.15 or 3.16, as will be many deprecated classes, functions and methods.[73][74] Design philosophy and features[edit] Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming[75] and metaobjects).[76] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[77][78] and logic programming.[79] Python is often referred to as a 'glue language'[80] because it can seamlessly integrate components written in other languages. Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[81] It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution. Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[82] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[83] Python's core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as these:[84] Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Readability counts. However, Python features regularly violate these principles and have received criticism for adding unnecessary language bloat.[85] Responses to these criticisms note that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule.[86] The addition of some new features had been controversial: Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life after conflict about adding the assignment expression operator in Python 3.8.[87][88] Nevertheless, rather than building all functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which represented the opposite approach.[42] Python claims to strive for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar, while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's motto "there is more than one way to do it", Python advocates an approach where "there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it.".[84] In practice, however, Python provides many ways to achieve a given goal. There are, for example, at least three ways to format a string literal, with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use.[89] Alex Martelli is a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author; he wrote that "To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture."[90] Python's developers usually try to avoid premature optimization; they also reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[91] Execution speed can be improved by moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or by using a just-in-time compiler like PyPy. It is also possible to cross-compile to other languages; but this approach either fails to achieve the expected speed-up, since Python is a very dynamic language, or only a restricted subset of Python is compiled (with potential minor semantic changes).[92] Python's developers aim for the language to be fun to use. This goal is reflected in the name a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[93] and in playful approaches to some tutorials and reference materials. For instance, some code examples use the terms "spam" and "eggs" (in reference to a Monty Python sketch), rather than the typical terms "foo" and "bar".[94][95] A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a wide range of meanings related to program style. Pythonic code may use Python idioms well; be natural or show fluency in the language; or conform with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability.[96] Syntax and semantics[edit] Main article: Python syntax and semantics An example of Python code and indentation Example of C# code with curly braces and semicolons Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.[97] Indentation[edit] Main article: Python syntax and semantics   Indentation Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[98] Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure.[99] This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.[100] Statements and control flow[edit] Python's statements include the following: The assignment statement, using a single equals sign = The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else if) The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses (or new syntax except* in Python 3.11 for exception groups[101]); the try statement also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block is always run regardless of how the block exits The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming The def statement, which defines a function or method The with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager, allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom[102] Examples of a context include acquiring a lock before some code is run, and then releasing the lock; or opening and then closing a file The break statement, which exits a loop The continue statement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next The del statement, which removes a variable deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined [a] The pass statement, serving as a NOP (i.e., no operation), which is syntactically needed to create an empty code block The assert statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function (and also an operator); used to implement coroutines The return statement, used to return a value from a function The import and from statements, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program The match and case statements, analogous to a switch statement construct, which compares an expression against one or more cases as a control-flow measure The assignment statement (=) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type. Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations; according to Van Rossum, the language never will.[103][104] However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python's generators.[105] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, data can be passed through multiple stack levels.[106] Expressions[edit] Python's expressions include the following: The +, -, and * operators for mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication are similar to other languages, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of division in Python: floor division (or integer division) //, and floating-point division /.[107] Python uses the ** operator for exponentiation. Python uses the + operator for string concatenation. The language uses the * operator for duplicating a string a specified number of times. The @ infix operator is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.[108][109] The syntax :=, called the "walrus operator", was introduced in Python 3.8. This operator assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.[110] In Python, == compares two objects by value. Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities (i.e., comparison by reference), and comparisons may be chained for example, a <= b <= c. Python uses and, or, and not as Boolean operators. Python has a type of expression called a list comprehension, and a more general expression called a generator expression.[82] Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, there may be only one expression in each body. Conditional expressions are written as x if c else y.[111] (This is different in operand order from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages.) Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (since dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples, written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided that all of the tuple's elements are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but produces a new tuple containing the elements of both. For example, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5); this result is then assigned back to t thereby effectively "modifying the contents" of t while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.[112] Python features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating to something assignable (e.g., a variable or a writable property) are associated just as in forming tuple literal; as a whole, the results are then put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. This statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign to produce the same number of values as the writable expressions on the left-hand side; while iterating, the statement assigns each of the values produced on the right to the corresponding expression on the left.[113] Python has a "string format" operator % that functions analogously to printf format strings in the C language e.g. "spam=%s eggs=%d" % ("blah", 2) evaluates to "spam=blah eggs=2". In Python 2.6+ and 3+, this operator was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g., "spam={0} eggs={1}".format("blah", 2). Python 3.6 added "f-strings": spam = "blah"; eggs = 2; f'spam={spam} eggs={eggs}'.[114] Strings in Python can be concatenated by "adding" them (using the same operator as for adding integers and floats); e.g., "spam" + "eggs" returns "spameggs". If strings contain numbers, they are concatenated as strings rather than as integers, e.g. "2" + "2" returns "22". Python supports string literals in several ways: Delimited by single or double quotation marks; single and double quotation marks have equivalent functionality (unlike in Unix shells, Perl, and Perl-influenced languages). Both marks use the backslash (\) as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as "formatted string literals".[114] Triple-quoted, i.e., starting and ending with three single or double quotation marks; this may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl, and Ruby. Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with r. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as in regular expressions and Windows-style paths. (Compare "@-quoting" in C#.) Python has array index and array slicing expressions in lists, which are written as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The (optional) third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped or reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted for example, a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy. In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This distinction leads to duplicating some functionality, for example: List comprehensions vs. for-loops Conditional expressions vs. if blocks The eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in Python 2, exec is a statement); the former function is for expressions, while the latter is for statements A statement cannot be part of an expression; because of this restriction, expressions such as list and dict comprehensions (and lambda expressions) cannot contain statements. As a particular case, an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot be part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. Methods[edit] Methods of objects are functions attached to the object's class; the syntax for normal methods and functions, instance.method(argument), is syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) parameter in some object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, Ruby).[115] Python also provides methods, often called dunder methods (because their names begin and end with double underscores); these methods allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations including length, comparison, arithmetic, and type conversion.[116] Typing[edit] The standard type hierarchy in Python 3 Python uses duck typing, and it has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at definition time; rather, operations on an object may fail at usage time, indicating that the object is not of an appropriate type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are poorly defined (e.g., adding a number and a string) rather than quietly attempting to interpret them. Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, most often for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class, for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()); the classes are instances of the metaclass type (which is an instance of itself), thereby allowing metaprogramming and reflection. Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes, both using the same syntax: old-style and new-style.[117] Current Python versions support the semantics of only the new style. Python supports optional type annotations.[4][118] These annotations are not enforced by the language, but may be used by external tools such as mypy to catch errors.[119][120] Mypy also supports a Python compiler called mypyc, which leverages type annotations for optimization.[121] Summary of Python 3's built-in types Type Mutability Description Syntax examples bool immutable Boolean value TrueFalse bytearray mutable Sequence of bytes bytearray(b'Some ASCII')bytearray(b"Some ASCII")bytearray([119, 105, 107, 105]) bytes immutable Sequence of bytes b'Some ASCII'b"Some ASCII"bytes([119, 105, 107, 105]) complex immutable Complex number with real and imaginary parts 3+2.7j3 + 2.7j dict mutable Associative array (or dictionary) of key and value pairs; can contain mixed types (keys and values); keys must be a hashable type {'key1': 1.0, 3: False}{} types.EllipsisType immutable An ellipsis placeholder to be used as an index in NumPy arrays ...Ellipsis float immutable Double-precision floating-point number. The precision is machine-dependent, but in practice it is generally implemented as a 64-bit IEEE 754 number with 53 bits of precision.[122] 1.33333 frozenset immutable Unordered set, contains no duplicates; can contain mixed types, if hashable frozenset([4.0, 'string', True]) int immutable Integer of unlimited magnitude[123] 42 list mutable List, can contain mixed types [4.0, 'string', True][] types.NoneType immutable An object representing the absence of a value, often called null in other languages None types.NotImplementedType immutable A placeholder that can be returned from overloaded operators to indicate unsupported operand types.

(With the module operator, a remainder can be negative, e.g., 4 % -3 == -2.) Python also offers the ** symbol for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0; it also offers the matrix multiplication operator @ .[125] These operators work as in traditional mathematics; with the same precedence rules, the infix operators + and - can also be unary, to represent positive and negative numbers respectively. Division between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:[126] The current version of Python (i.e., since 3.0) changed the / operator to always represent floating-point division, e.g., 5/2 == 2.5. The floor division // operator was introduced. Thus 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0, and -7.5//3 == -3.0. For outdated Python 2.7 adding the from __future__ import division statement causes a module in Python 2.7 to use Python 3.0 rules for division instead (see above). In Python terms, the / operator represents true division (or simply division), while the // operator represents floor division. Before version 3.0, the / operator represents classic division.[126] Rounding towards negative infinity, though a different method than in most languages, adds consistency to Python. For instance, this rounding implies that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. The rounding also implies that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. As expected, the result of a%b lies in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer; however, maintaining the validity of the equation requires that the result must lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.[127] Python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python 3 uses the round to even method: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2.[128] Python versions before 3 used the round-away-from-zero method: round(0.5) is 1.0, and round(-0.5) is  1.0.[129] Python allows Boolean expressions that contain multiple equality relations to be consistent with general usage in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c.[130] C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.[131] Python uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision with several rounding modes.[132] The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.[133] Due to Python's extensive mathematics library and the third-party library NumPy, the language is frequently used for scientific scripting in tasks such as numerical data processing and manipulation.[134][135] Function syntax[edit] Functions are created in Python by using the def keyword. A function is defined similarly to how it is called, by first providing the function name and then the required parameters. Here is an example of a function that prints its inputs: def printer(input1, input2="already there"): print(input1) print(input2) printer("hello") # Example output: # hello # already there To assign a default value to a function parameter in case no actual value is provided at run time, variable-definition syntax can be used inside the function header. Code examples[edit] "Hello, World!" program: print('Hello, world!') Program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer: n = int(input('Type a number, and its factorial will be printed: ')) if n < 0: raise ValueError('You must enter a non-negative integer') factorial = 1 for i in range(2, n + 1): factorial *= i print(factorial) Libraries[edit] Python's large standard library[136] is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. The language includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals,[132] manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing. Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333[137] but most parts are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules must be altered or rewritten for variant implementations. As of 13 March 2025,[update] the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 614,339[138] packages. These have a wide range of functionality, including the following: Automation Data analytics Databases Documentation Graphical user interfaces Image processing Machine learning Mobile apps Multimedia Computer networking Scientific computing System administration Test frameworks Text processing Web frameworks Web scraping Development environments[edit] See also: Comparison of integrated development environments   Python Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a read eval print loop (REPL); this permits the environment to function as a command line interpreter, with which users enter statements sequentially and receive results immediately. Python is also bundled with an integrated development environment (IDE) called IDLE, which is oriented toward beginners. Other shells, including IDLE and IPython, add additional capabilities such as improved auto-completion, session-state retention, and syntax highlighting. Standard desktop IDEs include PyCharm, IntelliJ Idea, Visual Studio Code; there are also web browser-based IDEs, such as the following environments: SageMath, for developing science- and math-related programs; Jupyter Notebooks, an open-source interactive computing platform; PythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial IDE that emphasizes scientific computing.[139][140] Implementations[edit] See also: List of Python software   Python implementations Reference implementation[edit] CPython is the reference implementation of Python. This implementation is written in C, meeting the C11 standard[141] (since version 3.11, older versions use the C89 standard with several select C99 features), but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versions e.g., they can be implemented using C11 or C++.[142][143] CPython compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode,[144] which is then executed by a virtual machine.[145] CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a combination of C and native Python. CPython is available for many platforms, including Windows and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python 3.9.1, using an experimental installer). Starting with Python 3.9, the Python installer intentionally fails to install on Windows 7 and 8;[146][147] Windows XP was supported until Python 3.5, with unofficial support for VMS.[148] Platform portability was one of Python's earliest priorities.[149] During development of Python 1 and 2, even OS/2 and Solaris were supported;[150] since that time, support has been dropped for many platforms. All current Python versions (since 3.7) support only operating systems that feature multithreading, by now supporting not nearly as many operating systems (dropping many outdated) than in the past. Other implementations[edit] All alternative implementations have at least slightly different semantic. For example, an alternative may include unordered dictionaries, in contrast to other current Python versions. As another example in the larger Python ecosystem, PyPy does not support the full C Python API. Alternative implementations include the following: PyPy is a fast, compliant interpreter of Python 2.7 and 3.10.[151][152] PyPy's just-in-time compiler often improves speed significantly relative to CPython, but PyPy does not support some libraries written in C.[153] PyPy offers support for the RISC-V instruction-set architecture, for example. Codon is an implentation with an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler, which compiles a statically-typed Python-like language whose "syntax and semantics are nearly identical to Python's, there are some notable differences"[154] For example, Codon uses 64-bit machine integers for speed, not arbitrarily as with Python; Codon developers claim that speedups over CPython are usually on the order of ten to a hundred times. Codon compiles to machine code (via LLVM) and supports native multithreading.[155] Codon can also compile to Python extension modules that can be imported and used from Python. MicroPython and CircuitPython are Python 3 variants that are optimized for microcontrollers, including the Lego Mindstorms EV3.[156] Pyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just-in-time compilation to speed up execution of Python programs.[157] Cinder is a performance-oriented fork of CPython 3.8 that features a number of optimizations, including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time JIT, and an experimental bytecode compiler.[158] The Snek[159][160][161] embedded computing language "is Python-inspired, but it is not Python. It is possible to write Snek programs that run under a full Python system, but most Python programs will not run under Snek."[162] Snek is compatible with 8-bit AVR microcontrollers such as ATmega 328P-based Arduino, as well as larger microcontrollers that are compatible with MicroPython. Snek is an imperative language that (unlike Python) omits object-oriented programming. Snek supports only one numeric data type, which features 32-bit single precision (resembling JavaScript numbers, though smaller). Unsupported implementations[edit] Stackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads. This implementation uses the call stack differently, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also offers a stackless version.[163] Just-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported: Google began a project named Unladen Swallow in 2009: this project aimed to speed up the Python interpreter five-fold by using LLVM, and improve multithreading capability for scaling to thousands of cores,[164] while typical implementations are limited by the global interpreter lock. Psyco is a discontinued just-in-time specializing compiler, which integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than standard Python code. Psyco does not support Python 2.7 or later. PyS60 was a Python 2 interpreter for Series 60 mobile phones, which was released by Nokia in 2005. The interpreter implemented many modules from Python's standard library, as well as additional modules for integration with the Symbian operating system. The Nokia N900 also supports Python through the GTK widget library, allowing programs to be written and run on the target device.[165] Cross-compilers to other languages[edit] There are several compilers/transpilers to high-level object languages; the source language is unrestricted Python, a subset of Python, or a language similar to Python: Brython,[166] Transcrypt,[167][168] and Pyjs compile Python to JavaScript. (The latest release of Pyjs was in 2012.) Cython compiles a superset of Python to C. The resulting code can be used with Python via direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter. PyJL compiles/transpiles a subset of Python to "human-readable, maintainable, and high-performance Julia source code".[92] Despite the developers' performance claims, this is not possible for arbitrary Python code; that is, compiling to a faster language or machine code is known to be impossible in the general case. The semantics of Python might potentially be changed, but in many cases speedup is possible with few or no changes in the Python code. The faster Julia source code can then be used from Python or compiled to machine code. Nuitka compiles Python into C.[169] This compiler works with Python 3.4 to 3.12 (and 2.6 and 2.7) for Python's main supported platforms (and Windows 7 or even Windows XP) and for Android. The compiler developers claim full support for Python 3.10, partial support for Python 3.11 and 3.12, and experimental support for Python 3.13. Nuitka supports macOS including Apple Silicon-based versions. The compiler is free of cost, though it has commercial add-ons (e.g., for hiding source code). Numba is a JIT compiler that is used from Python; the compiler translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. This tool is enabled by adding a decorator to the relevant Python code. Pythran compiles a subset of Python 3 to C++ (C++11).[170] RPython can be compiled to C, and it is used to build the PyPy interpreter for Python. The Python   11l   C++ transpiler[171] compiles a subset of Python 3 to C++ (C++17). There are also specialized compilers: MyHDL is a Python-based hardware description language (HDL) that converts MyHDL code to Verilog or VHDL code. Some older projects existed, as well as compilers not designed for use with Python 3.x and related syntax: Google's Grumpy transpiles Python 2 to Go.[172][173][174] The latest release was in 2017. IronPython allows running Python 2.7 programs with the .NET Common Language Runtime.[175] An alpha version (released in 2021), is available for "Python 3.4, although features and behaviors from later versions may be included."[176] Jython compiles Python 2.7 to Java bytecode, allowing the use of Java libraries from a Python program.[177] Pyrex (last released in 2010) and Shed Skin (last released in 2013) compile to C and C++ respectively. Performance[edit] A perforance comparison among various Python implementations, using a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload, was presented at EuroSciPy '13.[178] In addition, Python's performance relative to other programming languages is benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.[179] There are several approaches to optimizing Python performance, given the inherent slowness of an interpreted language. These approaches include the following strategies or tools: Just-in-time compilation: Dynamically compiling Python code just before it is executed. This technique is used in libraries such as Numba and PyPy. Static compilation: Python code is compiled into machine code sometime before execution. An example of this approach is Cython, which compiles Python into C. Concurrency and parallelism: Multiple tasks can be run simultaneously. Python contains modules such as `multiprocessing` to support this form of parallelism. Moreover, this approach helps to overcome limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPU tasks. Efficient data structures: Performance can also be improved by using data types such as Set for membership tests, or deque from collections for queue operations. Language Development[edit] Python's development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process; this process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues, and documenting Python design decisions.[180] Python coding style is covered in PEP 8.[181] Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.[180] Enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language's development. Specific issues were originally discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted by the foundation.[182] In 2022, all issues and discussions were migrated to GitHub.[183] Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.[184] CPython's public releases have three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented: Backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and must be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0. According to Guido van Rossum, a version 4.0 will probably never exist.[185] Major or "feature" releases are largely compatible with the previous version but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Starting with Python 3.9, these releases are expected to occur annually.[186][187] Each major version is supported by bug fixes for several years after its release.[188] Bug fix releases,[189] which introduce no new features, occur approximately every three months; these releases are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.[189] Many alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for releases, they are often delayed if the code is not ready yet. Python's development team monitors the state of the code by running a large unit test suite during development.[190] The major academic conference on Python is PyCon. There are also special Python mentoring programs, such as PyLadies. API documentation generators[edit] Tools that can generate documentation for Python API include pydoc (available as part of the standard library); Sphinx; and Pdoc and its forks, Doxygen and Graphviz.[191] Naming[edit] Python's name is inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture;[192] for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs, rather than the traditional foo and bar.[192][193] The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines.[194][195] Python users are sometimes referred to as "Pythonistas".[196] The affix Py is often used when naming Python applications or libraries. Some examples include the following: Pygame, a binding of Simple DirectMedia Layer to Python (commonly used to create games); PyQt and PyGTK, which bind Qt and GTK to Python respectively; PyPy, a Python implementation originally written in Python; NumPy, a Python library for numerical processing. Popularity[edit] Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten of the most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index; as of December 2022[update], Python was the most popular language.[40] Python was selected as Programming Language of the Year (for "the highest rise in ratings in a year") in 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020 the only language to have done so four times as of 2020[update][197]). In the TIOBE Index, monthly rankings are based on the volume of searches for programming languages on Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing, and 20 other platforms. According to the accompanying graph, Python has shown a marked upward trend since the early 2000s, eventually passing more established languages such as C, C++, and Java. This trend can be attributed to Python's readable syntax, comprehensive standard library, and application in data science and machine learning fields.[198] TIOBE Index Chart showing Python's popularity compared to other programming languages Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google,[199] Yahoo!,[200] CERN,[201] NASA,[202] Facebook,[203] Amazon, Instagram,[204] Spotify,[205] and some smaller entities such as Industrial Light & Magic[206] and ITA.[207] The social news networking site Reddit was developed mostly in Python.[208] Organizations that partly use Python include Discord[209] and Baidu.[210] Types of Use[edit] Main article: List of Python software Software that is powered by Python Python has many uses, including the following: Scripting for web applications Scientific computing Artificial-intelligence and machine-learning projects Graphical user interfaces and desktop environments Embedded scripting in software and hardware products Operating systems Information security Python can serve as a scripting language for web applications, e.g., via the mod_wsgi module for the Apache web server.[211] With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks such as Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle, and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as a data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communication between computers; this framework is used by Dropbox, for example. Libraries such as NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing,[212][213] with specialized libraries such as Biopython and Astropy providing domain-specific functionality. SageMath is a computer algebra system with a notebook interface that is programmable in Python; the SageMath library covers many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus.[214] OpenCV has Python bindings with a rich set of features for computer vision and image processing.[215] Python is commonly used in artificial-intelligence and machine-learning projects, with support from libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch, scikit-learn and ProbLog (a logic language).[216][217][218][219][220] As a scripting language with a modular architecture, simple syntax, and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing.[221] The combination of Python and Prolog has proven useful for AI applications, with Prolog providing knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities. The Janus system, in particular, exploits similarities between these two languages, in part because of their dynamic typing and their simple, recursive data structures. This combination is typically applied natural language processing, visual query answering, geospatial reasoning, and handling semantic web data.[222][223] The Natlog system, implemented in Python, uses Definite Clause Grammars (DCGs) to create prompts for two types of generators: text-to-text generators such as GPT3, and text-to-image generators such as DALL-E or Stable Diffusion.[224] Python can be used for graphical user interfaces (GUIs), by using libraries such as Tkinter.[225] Similarly, for the One Laptop per Child XO computer, most of the Sugar desktop environment is written in Python (as of 2008).[226] Python is embedded in many software products (and some hardware products) as a scripting language. These products include the following: finite element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric modelers such as FreeCAD, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke, 2D imaging programs such as GIMP,[227] Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro,[228] and musical notation programs such as scorewriter and capella. Similarly, GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ArcGIS.[229] Python has also been used in several video games,[230][231] and it has been adopted as first of the three programming languages available in Google App Engine (the other two being Java and Go).[232] LibreOffice includes Python, and its developers plan to replace Java with Python; LibreOffice's Python Scripting Provider is a core feature[233] since version 4.0 (from 7 February 2013). Among hardware products, the Raspberry Pi single-board computer project has adopted Python as its main user-programming language. Many operating systems include Python as a standard component. Python ships with most Linux distributions,[234] AmigaOS 4 (using Python 2.7), FreeBSD (as a package), NetBSD, and OpenBSD (as a package); it can be used from the command line (terminal). Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer, while Red Hat Linux and Fedora Linux use the Anaconda installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system, Portage.[235] Python is used extensively in the information security industry, including in exploit development.[236][237] Languages influenced by Python[edit] Python's design and philosophy have influenced many other programming languages: Boo uses indentation, a similar syntax, and a similar object model.[238] Cobra uses indentation and a similar syntax; its Acknowledgements document lists Python first among influencing languages.[239] CoffeeScript, a programming language that cross-compiles to JavaScript, has a Python-inspired syntax. ECMAScript JavaScript borrowed iterators and generators from Python.[240] GDScript, a Python-like scripting language that is built in to the Godot game engine.[241] Go is designed for "speed of working in a dynamic language like Python";[242] Go shares Python's syntax for slicing arrays. Groovy was motivated by a desire to incorporate the Python design philosophy into Java.[243] Julia was designed to be "as usable for general programming as Python".[27] Mojo is a non-strict[28][244] superset of Python (e.g., omitting classes, and adding struct).[245] Nim uses indentation and a similar syntax.[246] Ruby's creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto, said that "I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language."[247] Swift, a programming language developed by Apple, has some Python-inspired syntax.[248] Kotlin blends Python and Java features, which minimizes boilerplate code and enhances developer efficiency.[249] Python's development practices have also been emulated by other languages. For example, Python requires a document that describes the rationale and context for any language change; this document is known as a Python Enhancement Proposal or PEP. This practice is also used by the developers of Tcl,[250] Erlang,[251] and Swift.[252] See also[edit] Computer programming portalFree and open-source software portal Python syntax and semantics pip (package manager) List of programming languages History of programming languages Comparison of programming languages Notes[edit] ^ del in Python does not behave the same way delete in languages such as C++ does, where such a word is used to call the destructor and deallocate heap memory.

Best Way to Learn Python How to Run Python? If you are simply looking to learn Python step-by-step, you can follow our free tutorials in the next section. Beginner's Guide to Python These tutorials will provide you with a solid foundation in Python and prepare you for your career goals. Introduction How to Get Started With Python? Your First Python Program Python Comments Python Fundamentals Python Variables, Constants and Literals Python Type Conversion Python Basic Input and Output Python Operators Python Flow Control Python if...else Statement Python for Loop Python while Loop Python break and continue Python pass Statement Python Data Types Python Numbers, Type Conversion and Mathematics Python List Python Tuple Python Sets Python Dictionary Python Functions Python Functions Python Function Arguments Python Variable Scope Python Global Keyword Python Recursion Python Modules Python Package Python Main function Python Files Python Directory and Files Management Python CSV: Read and Write CSV files Reading CSV files in Python Writing CSV files in Python Python Exception Handling Python Exceptions Python Exception Handling Python Custom Exceptions Python Object and Class Python Objects and Classes Python Inheritance Python Multiple Inheritance Polymorphism in Python Python Operator Overloading Python Advanced Topics List comprehension Python Lambda/Anonymous Function Python Iterators Python Generators Python Namespace and Scope Python Closures Python Decorators Python @property decorator Python RegEx Python Date and Time Python datetime Python strftime() Python strptime() How to get current date and time in Python?

Whether Python is the right choice depends on what you want to accomplish and your career goals. Python from Learning Perspective If you are new to programming and prefer simplicity, Python is probably the right choice for you. Let's see an example. main.py x = 5 y = 10 print(x + y) main.c #include  int main() { int x = 5, y = 10; printf("%d", x + y); return 0; } Here, both programs in C and Python perform the same task. However, the Python code is much easier to understand, even if you have never been a programmer before. That being said, there are some advantages to learning languages like C as your first language. For example, C is much closer to the hardware and allows you to work with computer memory directly, thus providing you with a deeper understanding of how your code actually works. On the other hand, Python's clear, English-like syntax allows you to concentrate on problem-solving and building logic without being concerned about unnecessary complexities. So, it's up to you whether you want to quickly get started with programming or really take your time to understand the nitty-gritty parts of programming. Python as a Career Choice Python is a widely used programming language for creating real-world applications. It is extensively used in: Data Science Artificial Intelligence Automation Testing Backend Development Thus, learning Python offers significant advantages for your career opportunities. However, there are certain fields where Python doesn't excel. For example, if you are interested in frontend development, game development, or mobile app development, then Python is not the best choice. In these cases, alternatives such as JavaScript for frontend development, Kotlin, Swift, or Dart for mobile app development, and C++ for game development will be more suitable. Therefore, your career choices can guide you in selecting which programming language to learn. Best Way to Learn Python There is no right or wrong way to learn Python. It all depends on your learning style and pace. In this section, we have included the best Python learning resources tailored to your learning preferences, be it text-based, video-based, or interactive courses. Text-based Tutorial Best: if you are committed to learning Python but do not want to spend on it If you want to learn Python for free with a well-organized, step-by-step tutorial, you can use our free Python tutorials. Our tutorials will guide you through Python one step at a time, using practical examples to strengthen your foundation. Interactive Course Best: if you want hands-on learning, get your progress tracked, and maintain a learning streak Learning to code is tough. It requires dedication and consistency, and you need to write tons of code yourself. While videos and tutorials provide you with a step-by-step guide, they lack hands-on experience and structure. Recognizing all these challenges, Programiz offers a premium Learn Python Course that allows you to gain hands-on learning experience by solving challenges, building real-world projects, and tracking your progress. Online Video Best: if you are an audio-visual learner and learn by watching others code and following along If you're more of a visual learner, we have created a comprehensive Python course for beginners that will guide you on your Python journey. Additionally, there's a popular Python playlist by Corey Schafer available on YouTube to further guide you on your Python journey. If you're looking for a structured university course at zero cost, visit Python Course - University of Helsinki. Mobile App Best: if you are a casual and hobby learner who wants to learn Python on the go While it's possible to learn Python from mobile apps, it's not the ideal way because writing code can be challenging. Additionally, it's difficult to build real-world projects with multiple files on mobile devices. Nevertheless, you can use these apps to try things out. Learn Python Sololearn Important: You cannot learn to code without developing the habit of writing code yourself. Therefore, whatever method you choose, always write code. While writing code, you will encounter errors. Don't worry about them, try to understand them and find solutions. Remember, programming is all about solving problems, and errors are part of the process. How to Run Python? 1. Run Python in your browser.

It s typically divided into three categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. This article introduces the basics of machine learning theory, laying down the common concepts and techniques involved. This post is intended for people starting with machine learning, making it easy to follow the core concepts and get comfortable with machine learning basics. Machine Learning ExplainedMachine learning is an application of artificial intelligence in which a machine learns from past experiences or input data to make future predictions. There are three common categories of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. Machine learning basics explained. | Video: Fireship What Is Machine Learning? In 1959, Arthur Samuel, a computer scientist who pioneered the study of artificial intelligence, described machine learning as  the study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  Alan Turing s seminal paper introduced a benchmark standard for demonstrating machine intelligence, such that a machine has to be intelligent and responsive in a manner that cannot be differentiated from that of a human being. A more technical definition given by Tom M. Mitchell s 1997 paper:  A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.  For example, a handwriting recognition learning problem: Task T: Recognizing and classifying handwritten words within images. Performance measure P: Percent of words correctly classified, accuracy. Training experience E: A data-set of handwritten words with given classifications. In order to perform the task T, the system learns from the data set provided. A data set is a collection of many examples. An example is a collection of features. Common Types of Machine Learning Machine learning is generally categorized into three types: Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning. 1. Supervised Learning In supervised learning, the machine experiences the examples, along with the labels or targets for each example. The labels in the data help the algorithm to correlate the features. Two of the most common supervised machine learning tasks are classification and regression. In classification, the machine learning model takes in data and predicts the most likely category, class or label it belongs to based on its values. Some examples of classification include predicting stock prices and categorizing articles to news, politics or leisure based on its content. In regression, the machine predicts the value of a continuous response variable. Common examples include predicting sales of a new product or a salary for a job based on its description. 2. Unsupervised Learning When we have unclassified and unlabeled data, the system attempts to uncover patterns from the data. There is no label or target given for the examples. One common task is to group similar examples together called clustering. 3. Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning refers to goal-oriented algorithms, which learn how to attain a complex objective (goal) or maximize along a particular dimension over many steps. This method allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context in order to maximize its performance. Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn which action is best. This is known as the reinforcement signal. For example, maximizing the points won in a game over a lot of moves. Supervised Machine Learning Techniques Regression is a technique used to predict the value of response (dependent) variables from one or more predictor (independent) variables. Most commonly used regressions techniques are linear regression and logistic regression. We will discuss the theory behind these two prominent techniques alongside explaining many other key concepts like gradient descent algorithm, overfit and underfit, error analysis, regularization, hyperparameters and cross-validation techniques involved in machine learning. Linear Regression In linear regression problems, the goal is to predict a real-value variable y from a given pattern X. In the case of linear regression the output is a linear function of the input. Let y  be the output our model predicts: y  = WX+b Here X is a vector or features of an example, W are the weights or vector of parameters that determine how each feature affects the prediction, and b is a bias term. So, our task T is to predict y from X. Now ,we need to measure performance P to know how well the model performs. To calculate the performance of the model, we first calculate the error of each example i as: Calculation for the error of each example i. | Image: Javaid Nabi We then take the absolute value of the error to take into account both positive and negative values of error. Finally, we calculate the mean for all recorded absolute errors or the average sum of all absolute errors. Mean absolute error (MAE) equals the average of all absolute errors: Mean absolute error equation. | Image: Javaid Nabi A more popular way of measuring model performance is using Mean squared error (MSE). This is the average of squared differences between prediction and actual observation. Mean squared error equation. | Image: Javaid Nabi The mean is halved as a convenience for the computation of the gradient descent, as the derivative term of the square function will cancel out the half term. The main aim of training the machine learning algorithm is to adjust the weights W to reduce the MAE or MSE. To minimize the error, the model updates the model parameters W while experiencing the examples of the training set. These error calculations when plotted against the W is also called cost function J(w), since it determines the cost/penalty of the model. So, minimizing the error is also called as minimizing the cost function J. Gradient Descent Algorithm In the gradient descent algorithm, we start with random model parameters and calculate the error for each learning iteration, keep updating the model parameters to move closer to the values that results in minimum cost. Repeat until minimum cost: Minimum cost equation. | Image: Javaid Nabi In the above equation, we are updating the model parameters after each iteration. The second term of the equation calculates the slope or gradient of the curve at each iteration. The gradient of the cost function is calculated as a partial derivative of cost function J with respect to each model parameter wj, where j takes the value of number of features [1 to n].  , alpha, is the learning rate, or how quickly we want to move towards the minimum. If   is too large, we can overshoot. If   is too small, it means small steps of learning, which increases the overall time it takes the model to observe all examples. There are three ways of doing gradient descent: Batch gradient descent: Uses all of the training instances to update the model parameters in each iteration. Mini-batch gradient descent: Instead of using all examples, mini-batch gradient descent divides the training set into a smaller size called batch denoted by  b . Thus a mini-batch  b  is used to update the model parameters in each iteration. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD): This updates the parameters using only a single training instance in each iteration. The training instance is usually selected randomly. Stochastic gradient descent is often preferred to optimize cost functions when there are hundreds of thousands of training instances or more, as it will converge more quickly than batch gradient descent. Logistic Regression In some problems the response variable isn t normally distributed. For instance, a coin toss can result in two outcomes: heads or tails. The Bernoulli distribution describes the probability distribution of a random variable that can take the positive case with probability P or the negative case with probability 1-P. If the response variable represents a probability, it must be constrained to the range {0,1}. In logistic regression, the response variable describes the probability that the outcome is the positive case. If the response variable is equal to or exceeds a discrimination threshold, the positive class is predicted. Otherwise, the negative class is predicted. The response variable is modeled as a function of a linear combination of the input variables using the logistic function. Since our hypotheses y  has to satisfy 0   y    1, this can be accomplished by plugging logistic function or sigmoid function: Sigmoid function equation. | Image: Javaid Nabi The function g(z) maps any real number to the (0, 1) interval, making it useful for transforming an arbitrary-valued function into a function better suited for classification. Now, coming back to our logistic regression problem, let s assume that z is a linear function of a single explanatory variable x. We can then express z as follows: Z equation for linear function. | Image: Javaid Nabi And the logistic function can now be written as: Logistic function. | Image: Javaid Nabi g(x) is interpreted as the probability of the dependent variable. g(x) = 0.7, gives us a probability of 70 percent that our output is one. Our probability that our prediction is zero is just the complement of our probability that it is one. For example, if the probability that it s one is 70 percent, then the probability that it is zero is 30 percent. The input to the sigmoid function g doesn t need to be a linear function. It can be a circle or any shape. Linear function. | Image: Javaid Nabi Cost Function We cannot use the same cost function that we used for linear regression because the sigmoid function will cause the output to be wavy, causing many local optima. In other words, it will not be a convex function. In order to ensure the cost function is convex   and therefore, ensure convergence to the global minimum   the cost function is transformed using the logarithm of the sigmoid function. The cost function for logistic regression looks like: Cost function for linear regression. | Image: Javaid Nabi Cost function equation explanation. | Image: Javaid Nabi Which can be written as: Cost function rewritten. | Image: Javaid Nabi So, the cost function for logistic regression is: Cost function for logistic regression. | Image: Javaid Nabi Since the cost function is a convex function, we can run the gradient descent algorithm to find the minimum cost. What Is Underfitting and Overfitting in Machine Learning? We try to make the machine learning algorithm fit the input data by increasing or decreasing the model s capacity. In linear regression problems, we increase or decrease the degree of the polynomials. Consider the problem of predicting y from x   R. Since the data doesn t lie in a straight line, the fit is not very good. To increase model capacity, we add another feature by adding the term x  to it. This produces a better fit. But if we keep on doing so x , fifth order polynomial), we may be able to better fit the data but it will not generalize well for new data. Underfitting When the model has fewer features, it isn t able to learn from the data very well   known as underfitting. This means the model has a high bias. Overfitting When the model has complex functions, it s able to fit the data but is not able to generalize to predict new data   known as overfitting. This model has high variance. There are three main options to address the issue of overfitting: Reduce the number of features: Manually select which features to keep. We may miss some important information if we throw away features. Regularization: Keep all the features, but reduce the magnitude of weights W. Regularization works well when we have a lot of slightly useful features. Early stopping: When we are training a learning algorithm iteratively such as using gradient descent, we can measure how well each iteration of the model performs. Up to a certain number of iterations, each iteration improves the model. After that point, however, the model s ability to generalize can weaken as it begins to overfit the training data. Regularization in Machine Learning Regularization can be applied to both linear and logistic regression by adding a penalty term to the error function in order to discourage the coefficients or weights from reaching large values. Linear Regression With Regularization The simplest such penalty term takes the form of a sum of squares of all of the coefficients, leading to a modified linear regression error function: Linear regression error function. | Image: Javaid Nabi Where lambda is our regularization parameter. In order to minimize the error, we use the gradient descent algorithm. We keep updating the model parameters to move closer to the values that result in minimum cost. Then repeat until convergence, with regularization: Repeat gradient descent algorithm to convergence. | Image: Javaid Nabi   Equation continued to convergence. | Image: Javaid Nabi With some manipulation, the above equation can also be represented as: Manipulation of above equation. | Image: Javaid Nabi The first term in the above equation will always be less than one: First term is always less than 1 equation. | Image: Javaid Nabi You can see it as reducing the value of the coefficient by some amount on every update. Logistic Regression With Regularization The cost function of the logistic regression with regularization is: Cost function of logistic regression with regularization. | Image: Javaid Nabi Then, repeat until convergence with regularization: Equation continued until convergence with regularization. | Image: Javaid Nabi Equation continued with regularization. | Image: Javaid Nabi L1 and L2 Regularization The regularization term used in the previous equations is called L2 regularization, or ridge regression. L2 equation. | Image: Javaid Nabi The L2 penalty aims to minimize the squared magnitude of the weights. There is another regularization called L1 regularization, or lasso regression: L1 equation. | Image: Javaid Nabi The L1 penalty aims to minimize the absolute value of the weights. Difference Between L1 and L2 Regularization L2 shrinks all the coefficients by the same proportions but eliminates none. L1 can shrink some coefficients to zero, thus performing feature selection. Hyperparameters Hyperparameters are higher-level parameters that describe structural information about a model that must be decided before fitting model parameters. Examples of hyperparameters we discussed so far include: Learning rate (alpha) and regularization (lambda). Cross-Validation The process to select the optimal values of hyperparameters is called model selection. If we reuse the same test data set over and over again during model selection, it will become part of our training data, and the model will be more likely to over fit. The overall data set is divided into three categories: Training data set Validation data set Test data set The training set is used to fit the different models, and the performance on the validation set is then used for the model selection. The advantage of keeping a test set that the model hasn t seen before during the training and model selection steps is to avoid overfitting the model. The model is able to better generalize to unseen data. In many applications, however, the supply of data for training and testing will be limited, and in order to build good models, we wish to use as much of the available data as possible for training. However, if the validation set is small, it will give a relatively noisy estimate of predictive performance. One solution to this dilemma is to use cross-validation. More on Machine LearningUnderstanding Feature Importance in Machine Learning 7 Steps of Cross-Validation These are the steps for selecting hyper-parameters using K-fold cross-validation: Split your training data into K = 4 equal parts, or  folds.  Choose a set of hyperparameters you wish to optimize. Train your model with that set of hyperparameters on the first three folds. Evaluate it on the fourth fold, or the hold-out fold. Repeat steps (3) and (4) four times with the same set of hyperparameters, each time holding out a different fold. Aggregate the performance across all four folds. This is your performance metric for the set of hyperparameters. Repeat steps (2) to (6) for all sets of hyperparameters you wish to consider. Cross-validation allows us to tune hyperparameters with only our training set. This allows us to keep the test set as a truly unseen data set for selecting the final model. We ve covered some of the key concepts in the field of machine learning, starting with the definition of machine learning and then covering different types of machine learning techniques. We discussed the theory behind the most common regression techniques (linear and logistic) alongside other key concepts of machine learning.

In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.It can be broadly categorized into four types:Types of Machine LearningSupervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.Note: Self-supervised learning is not one of the original three, but it has become a major category in deep learning and fields like NLP and computer vision.Semi-Supervised Learning: The model generates its own labels from the data, so we don t need human-annotated labels.Module 1: Machine Learning PipelineIn order to make predictions there are some steps through which data passes in order to produce a machine learning model that can make predictions. ML workflowData CleaningFeature ScalingData Preprocessing in PythonModule 2: Supervised Learning Supervised learning algorithms are generally categorized into two main types: Classification - where the goal is to predict discrete labels or categories Regression - where the aim is to predict continuous numerical values.

RL allows machines to learn by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback based on their actions. This feedback comes in the form of rewards or penalties. Reinforcement Learning revolves around the idea that an agent (the learner or decision-maker) interacts with an environment to achieve a goal. The agent performs actions and receives feedback to optimize its decision-making over time.Agent: The decision-maker that performs actions.Environment: The world or system in which the agent operates.State: The situation or condition the agent is currently in.Action: The possible moves or decisions the agent can make.Reward: The feedback or result from the environment based on the agent s action.How Reinforcement Learning Works?The RL process involves an agent performing actions in an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on those actions, and adjusting its behavior accordingly. This loop helps the agent improve its decision-making over time to maximize the cumulative reward.Here s a breakdown of RL components:Policy: A strategy that the agent uses to determine the next action based on the current state.Reward Function: A function that provides feedback on the actions taken, guiding the agent towards its goal.Value Function: Estimates the future cumulative rewards the agent will receive from a given state.Model of the Environment: A representation of the environment that predicts future states and rewards, aiding in planning.Reinforcement Learning Example: Navigating a MazeImagine a robot navigating a maze to reach a diamond while avoiding fire hazards. The goal is to find the optimal path with the least number of hazards while maximizing the reward:Each time the robot moves correctly, it receives a reward.If the robot takes the wrong path, it loses points.The robot learns by exploring different paths in the maze. By trying various moves, it evaluates the rewards and penalties for each path. Over time, the robot determines the best route by selecting the actions that lead to the highest cumulative reward.The robot's learning process can be summarized as follows:Exploration: The robot starts by exploring all possible paths in the maze, taking different actions at each step (e.g., move left, right, up, or down).Feedback: After each move, the robot receives feedback from the environment:A positive reward for moving closer to the diamond.A penalty for moving into a fire hazard.Adjusting Behavior: Based on this feedback, the robot adjusts its behavior to maximize the cumulative reward, favoring paths that avoid hazards and bring it closer to the diamond.Optimal Path: Eventually, the robot discovers the optimal path with the least number of hazards and the highest reward by selecting the right actions based on past experiences.Types of Reinforcements in RL 1. Positive Reinforcement Positive Reinforcement is defined as when an event, occurs due to a particular behavior, increases the strength and the frequency of the behavior. In other words, it has a positive effect on behavior. Advantages: Maximizes performance, helps sustain change over time.Disadvantages: Overuse can lead to excess states that may reduce effectiveness.2. Negative ReinforcementNegative Reinforcement is defined as strengthening of behavior because a negative condition is stopped or avoided. Advantages: Increases behavior frequency, ensures a minimum performance standard.Disadvantages: It may only encourage just enough action to avoid penalties.CartPole in OpenAI GymOne of the classic RL problems is the CartPole environment in OpenAI Gym, where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart. The agent can either push the cart left or right to prevent the pole from falling over.State space: Describes the four key variables (position, velocity, angle, angular velocity) of the cart-pole system.Action space: Discrete actions either move the cart left or right.Reward: The agent earns 1 point for each step the pole remains balanced. Python import gym import numpy as np import warnings # Suppress specific deprecation warnings warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=DeprecationWarning) # Load the environment with render mode specified env = gym.make('CartPole-v1', render_mode="human") # Initialize the environment to get the initial state state = env.reset() # Print the state space and action space print("State space:", env.observation_space) print("Action space:", env.action_space) # Run a few steps in the environment with random actions for _ in range(10): env.render() # Render the environment for visualization action = env.action_space.sample() # Take a random action # Take a step in the environment step_result = env.step(action) # Check the number of values returned and unpack accordingly if len(step_result) == 4: next_state, reward, done, info = step_result terminated = False else: next_state, reward, done, truncated, info = step_result terminated = done or truncated print(f"Action: {action}, Reward: {reward}, Next State: {next_state}, Done: {done}, Info: {info}") if terminated: state = env.reset() # Reset the environment if the episode is finished env.close() # Close the environment when done Output: Application of Reinforcement LearningRobotics: RL is used to automate tasks in structured environments such as manufacturing, where robots learn to optimize movements and improve efficiency.Game Playing: Advanced RL algorithms have been used to develop strategies for complex games like chess, Go, and video games, outperforming human players in many instances.Industrial Control: RL helps in real-time adjustments and optimization of industrial operations, such as refining processes in the oil and gas industry.Personalized Training Systems: RL enables the customization of instructional content based on an individual's learning patterns, improving engagement and effectiveness.Advantages of Reinforcement LearningSolving Complex Problems: RL is capable of solving highly complex problems that cannot be addressed by conventional techniques.Error Correction: The model continuously learns from its environment and can correct errors that occur during the training process.Direct Interaction with the Environment: RL agents learn from real-time interactions with their environment, allowing adaptive learning.Handling Non-Deterministic Environments: RL is effective in environments where outcomes are uncertain or change over time, making it highly useful for real-world applications.Disadvantages of Reinforcement LearningNot Suitable for Simple Problems: RL is often an overkill for straightforward tasks where simpler algorithms would be more efficient.High Computational Requirements: Training RL models requires a significant amount of data and computational power, making it resource-intensive.Dependency on Reward Function: The effectiveness of RL depends heavily on the design of the reward function. Poorly designed rewards can lead to suboptimal or undesired behaviors.Difficulty in Debugging and Interpretation: Understanding why an RL agent makes certain decisions can be challenging, making debugging and troubleshooting complexReinforcement Learning is a powerful technique for decision-making and optimization in dynamic environments. However, the complexity of RL necessitates careful design of reward functions and substantial computational resources. By understanding its principles and applications, RL can be leveraged to solve intricate real-world problems and drive advancements across various industries.

Supervised Machine Learning Last Updated : 02 Jan, 2025 Comments Improve Suggest changes Like Article Like Report Supervised machine learning is a fundamental approach for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It involves training a model using labeled data, where each input comes with a corresponding correct output. The process is like a teacher guiding a student hence the term "supervised" learning. In this article, we'll explore the key components of supervised learning, the different types of supervised machine learning algorithms used, and some practical examples of how it works. Supervised Machine LearningWhat is Supervised Machine Learning? As we explained before, supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data meaning each input is paired with the correct output. the model learns by comparing its predictions with the actual answers provided in the training data. Over time, it adjusts itself to minimize errors and improve accuracy. The goal of supervised learning is to make accurate predictions when given new, unseen data. For example, if a model is trained to recognize handwritten digits, it will use what it learned to correctly identify new numbers it hasn't seen before.Supervised learning can be applied in various forms, including supervised learning classification and supervised learning regression, making it a crucial technique in the field of artificial intelligence and supervised data mining.A fundamental concept in supervised machine learning is learning a class from examples. This involves providing the model with examples where the correct label is known, such as learning to classify images of cats and dogs by being shown labeled examples of both. The model then learns the distinguishing features of each class and applies this knowledge to classify new images.How Supervised Machine Learning Works?Where supervised learning algorithm consists of input features and corresponding output labels. The process works through:Training Data: The model is provided with a training dataset that includes input data (features) and corresponding output data (labels or target variables).Learning Process: The algorithm processes the training data, learning the relationships between the input features and the output labels. This is achieved by adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual labels.After training, the model is evaluated using a test dataset to measure its accuracy and performance. Then the model's performance is optimized by adjusting parameters and using techniques like cross-validation to balance bias and variance. This ensures the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.In summary, supervised machine learning involves training a model on labeled data to learn patterns and relationships, which it then uses to make accurate predictions on new data.Let's learn how a supervised machine learning model is trained on a dataset to learn a mapping function between input and output, and then with learned function is used to make predictions on new data:In the image above,Training phase involves feeding the algorithm labeled data, where each data point is paired with its correct output. The algorithm learns to identify patterns and relationships between the input and output data.Testing phase involves feeding the algorithm new, unseen data and evaluating its ability to predict the correct output based on the learned patterns.Types of Supervised Learning in Machine LearningNow, Supervised learning can be applied to two main types of problems:Classification: Where the output is a categorical variable (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails, yes vs. no).Regression: Where the output is a continuous variable (e.g., predicting house prices, stock prices).While training the model, data is usually split in the ratio of 80:20 i.e. 80% as training data and the rest as testing data. In training data, we feed input as well as output for 80% of data. The model learns from training data only. We use different supervised learning algorithms (which we will discuss in detail in the next section) to build our model. Let's first understand the classification and regression data through the table below: Both the above figures have labelled data set as follows: Figure A: It is a dataset of a shopping store that is useful in predicting whether a customer will purchase a particular product under consideration or not based on his/ her gender, age, and salary. Input: Gender, Age, Salary Output: Purchased i.e. 0 or 1; 1 means yes the customer will purchase and 0 means that the customer won't purchase it. Figure B: It is a Meteorological dataset that serves the purpose of predicting wind speed based on different parameters. Input: Dew Point, Temperature, Pressure, Relative Humidity, Wind Direction Output: Wind Speed Refer to this article for more information of Types of Machine Learning Practical Examples of Supervised learningFew practical examples of supervised machine learning across various industries:Fraud Detection in Banking: Utilizes supervised learning algorithms on historical transaction data, training models with labeled datasets of legitimate and fraudulent transactions to accurately predict fraud patterns.Parkinson Disease Prediction: Parkinson s disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body controlled by the nerves.Customer Churn Prediction: Uses supervised learning techniques to analyze historical customer data, identifying features associated with churn rates to predict customer retention effectively.Cancer cell classification: Implements supervised learning for cancer cells based on their features, and identifying them if they are  malignant  or  benign.Stock Price Prediction: Applies supervised learning to predict a signal that indicates whether buying a particular stock will be helpful or not.Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms Supervised learning can be further divided into several different types, each with its own unique characteristics and applications. Here are some of the most common types of supervised learning algorithms: Linear Regression: Linear regression is a type of supervised learning regression algorithm that is used to predict a continuous output value. It is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in supervised learning.Logistic Regression : Logistic regression is a type of supervised learning classification algorithm that is used to predict a binary output variable. Decision Trees : Decision tree is a tree-like structure that is used to model decisions and their possible consequences. Each internal node in the tree represents a decision, while each leaf node represents a possible outcome. Random Forests : Random forests again are made up of multiple decision trees that work together to make predictions. Each tree in the forest is trained on a different subset of the input features and data. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all the trees in the forest. Support Vector Machine(SVM) : The SVM algorithm creates a hyperplane to segregate n-dimensional space into classes and identify the correct category of new data points. The extreme cases that help create the hyperplane are called support vectors, hence the name Support Vector Machine.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) : KNN works by finding k training examples closest to a given input and then predicts the class or value based on the majority class or average value of these neighbors. The performance of KNN can be influenced by the choice of k and the distance metric used to measure proximity.Gradient Boosting : Gradient Boosting combines weak learners, like decision trees, to create a strong model. It iteratively builds new models that correct errors made by previous ones. Naive Bayes Algorithm: The Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm based on applying Bayes' Theorem with the  naive  assumption that features are independent of each other given the class label. Let's summarize the supervised machine learning algorithms in table:AlgorithmRegression,ClassificationPurposeMethodUse CasesLinear RegressionRegressionPredict continuous output valuesLinear equation minimizing sum of squares of residualsPredicting continuous valuesLogistic RegressionClassificationPredict binary output variableLogistic function transforming linear relationshipBinary classification tasksDecision TreesBothModel decisions and outcomesTree-like structure with decisions and outcomesClassification and Regression tasksRandom ForestsBothImprove classification and regression accuracyCombining multiple decision treesReducing overfitting, improving prediction accuracySVMBothCreate hyperplane for classification or predict continuous valuesMaximizing margin between classes or predicting continuous valuesClassification and Regression tasksKNNBothPredict class or value based on k closest neighborsFinding k closest neighbors and predicting based on majority or averageClassification and Regression tasks, sensitive to noisy dataGradient BoostingBothCombine weak learners to create strong modelIteratively correcting errors with new modelsClassification and Regression tasks to improve prediction accuracyNaive BayesClassificationPredict class based on feature independence assumptionBayes' theorem with feature independence assumptionText classification, spam filtering, sentiment analysis, medicalThese types of supervised learning in machine learning vary based on the problem you're trying to solve and the dataset you're working with. In classification problems, the task is to assign inputs to predefined classes, while regression problems involve predicting numerical outcomes.Training a Supervised Learning Model: Key StepsThe goal of Supervised learning is to generalize well to unseen data. Training a model for supervised learning involves several crucial steps, each designed to prepare the model to make accurate predictions or decisions based on labeled data. Below are the key steps involved in training a model for supervised machine learning:Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather a labeled dataset consisting of input features and target output labels. Clean the data, handle missing values, and scale features as needed to ensure high quality for supervised learning algorithms.Splitting the Data: Divide the data into training set (80%) and the test set (20%). Choosing the Model: Select appropriate algorithms based on the problem type. This step is crucial for effective supervised learning in AI.Training the Model: Feed the model input data and output labels, allowing it to learn patterns by adjusting internal parameters.

ML handles new data and scales the growing demand for technology with valuable insight. It improves the performance over time. This cutting-edge technology has various benefits such as faster processing or response, enhancement of decision-making, and specialized services. In this article, we will discuss Machine Learning Models, their types, How Machine Learning works, Real-world examples of ML Models, and the Future of Machine Learning Models. Machine Leraning ModelsA model of machine learning is a set of programs that can be used to find the pattern and make a decision from an unseen dataset. These days NLP (Natural language Processing) uses the machine learning model to recognize the unstructured text into usable data and insights. You may have heard about image recognition which is used to identify objects such as boy, girl, mirror, car, dog, etc. A model always requires a dataset to perform various tasks during training. In training duration, we use a machine learning algorithm for the optimization process to find certain patterns or outputs from the dataset based upon tasks.

Reinforcement learning Models4.1 Value-based learning:4.2 Policy-based learning:Deep LearningHow Machine Learning Works?Advanced Machine Learning ModelsReal-world examples of ML Models Future of Machine Learning ModelsConclusionTypes of Machine Learning ModelsMachine learning models can be broadly categorized into four main paradigms based on the type of data and learning goals:1. Supervised ModelsSupervised learning is the study of algorithms that use labeled data in which each data instance has a known category or value to which it belongs. This results in the model to discover the relationship between the input features and the target outcome.1.1 ClassificationThe classifier algorithms are designed to indicate whether a new data point belongs to one or another among several predefined classes. Imagine when you are organising emails into spam or inbox, categorising images as cat or dog, or predicting whether a loan applicant is a credible borrower. In the classification models, there is a learning process by the use of labeled examples from each category. In this process, they discover the correlations and relations within the data that help to distinguish class one from the other classes. After learning these patterns, the model is then capable of assigning these class labels to unseen data points.Common Classification Algorithms:Logistic Regression: A very efficient technique for the classification problems of binary nature (two types, for example, spam/not spam).Support Vector Machine (SVM): Good for tasks like classification, especially when the data has a large number of features.Decision Tree: Constructs a decision tree having branches and proceeds to the class predictions through features.Random Forest: The model generates an "ensemble" of decision trees that ultimately raise the accuracy and avoid overfitting (meaning that the model performs great on the training data but lousily on unseen data).K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Assigns a label of the nearest neighbors for a given data point.1.2 RegressionRegression algorithms are about forecasting of a continuous output variable using the input features as their basis. This value could be anything such as predicting real estate prices or stock market trends to anticipating customer churn (how likely customers stay) and sales forecasting. Regression models make the use of features to understand the relationship among the continuous features and the output variable. That is, they use the pattern that is learned to determine the value of the new data points.Common Regression AlgorithmsLinear Regression: Fits depth of a line to the data to model for the relationship between features and the continuous output.Polynomial Regression: Similiar to linear regression but uses more complex polynomial functions such as quadratic, cubic, etc, for accommodating non-linear relationships of the data.Decision Tree Regression: Implements a decision tree-based algorithm that predicts a continuous output variable from a number of branching decisions.Random Forest Regression: Creates one from several decision trees to guarantee error-free and robust regression prediction results.Support Vector Regression (SVR): Adjusts the Support Vector Machine ideas for regression tasks, where we are trying to find one hyperplane that most closely reflects continuous output data.2. Unsupervised ModelsUnsupervised learning involves a difficult task of working with data which is not provided with pre-defined categories or label.2.1 ClusteringVisualize being given a basket of fruits with no labels on them. The fruits clustering algorithms are to group them according to the inbuilt similarities. Techniques like K-means clustering are defined by exact number of clusters ("red fruits" and "green fruits") and then each data point (fruit) is assigned to the cluster with the highest similarity within based on features (color, size, texture). Contrary to this, hierarchical clustering features construction of hierarchy of clusters which makes it more easy to study the system of groups. Spatial clustering algorithm Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) detects groups of high-density data points, even in those areas where there is a lack of data or outliers.2.2 Dimensionality ReductionSometimes it is difficult to both visualize and analyze the data when you have a large feature space (dimensions). The purpose of dimensionality reduction methods is to decrease the dimensions needed to maintain the key features. Dimensions of greatest importance are identified by principal component analysis (PCA), which is the reason why data is concentrated in fewer dimensions with the highest variations. This speeds up model training as well as offers a chance for more efficient visualization. LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) also resembles PCA but it is made for classification tasks where it concentrates on dimensions that can differentiate the present classes in the dataset.2.3 Anomaly DetectionUnsupervised learning can also be applied to find those data points which greatly differ than the majorities. The statistics model may identify these outliers, or anomalies as signaling of errors, fraud or even something unusual. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) makes a comparison of a given data point's local density with those surrounding it. It then flags out the data points with significantly lower densities as outliers or potential anomalies. Isolation Forest is the one which uses different approach, which is to recursively isolate data points according to their features. Anomalies usually are simple to contemplate as they often necessitate fewer steps than an average normal point.3. Semi-Supervised ModelBesides, supervised learning is such a kind of learning with labeled data that unsupervised learning, on the other hand, solves the task where there is no labeled data. Lastly, semi-supervised learning fills the gap between the two. It reveals the strengths of both approaches by training using data sets labeled along with unlabeled one. This is especially the case when labeled data might be sparse or prohibitively expensive to acquire, while unlabeled data is undoubtedly available in abundance.3.1 Generative Semi-Supervised LearningEnvision having a few pictures of cats with labels and a universe of unlabeled photos. The big advantage of generative semi-supervised learning is its utilization of such a scenario. It exploits a generative model to investigate the unlabeled pictures and discover the orchestrating factors that characterize the data. This technique can then be used to generate the new synthetic data points that have the same features with the unlabeled data. The synthetic data is then labeled with the pseudo-labels that the generative model has interpreted from the data. This approach combines the existing labeled data with the newly generated labeled data to train the final model which is likely to perform better than the previous model that was trained with only the limited amount of the original labeled data.3.2 Graph-based Semi-Supervised LearningThis process makes use of the relationships between data points and propagates labels to unmarked ones via labeled ones. Picture a social network platform where some of the users have been marked as fans of sports (labeled data). Cluster-based methods can analyze the links between users (friendships) and even apply this information to infer that if a user is connected to someone with a "sports" label then this user might also be interested in sports (unbiased labels with propagated label). While links and the entire structure of the network are also important for the distribution of labels. This method is beneficial when the data points are themselves connected to each other and this connection can be exploiting during labelling of new data.4. Reinforcement learning ModelsReinforcement learning takes a dissimilar approach from supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Different from supervised learning or just plain discovery of hidden patterns, reinforcement learning adopt an agent as it interacts with the surrounding and learns. This agent is a learning one which develops via experiment and error, getting rewarded for the desired actions and punished for the undesired ones. The main purpose is to help players play the game that can result in the highest rewards.4.1 Value-based learning:Visualize a robot trying to find its way through a maze. It has neither a map nor instructions, but it gets points for consuming the cheese at the end and fails with deduction of time when it runs into a wall. Value learning is an offshoot of predicting the anticipated future reward of taking a step in a particular state. For example, the algorithm Q-learning will learn a Q-value for each state-action combination. This Q-value is the expected reward for that action at that specific state. Through a repetitive process of assessing the state, gaining rewards, and updating the Q-values the agent manages to determine that which actions are most valuable in each state and eventually guides it to the most rewarding path. In contrast, SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) looks at the value of the succeeding state-action pair that influences the exploration strategy.4.2 Policy-based learning:In contrast to the value-based learning, where we are learning a specific value for each state-action pair, in policy-based learning we are trying to directly learn a policy which maps states to actions. This policy in essence commands the agent to act in different situations as specified by the way it is written. Actor-Critic is a common approach that combines two models: an actor that retrains the policy and a critic that retrains the value function (just like value-based methods). The actor witnesses the critic's feedback which updates the policy that the actor uses for better decision making. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a specific policy-based method which focuses on high variance issues that complicate early policy-based learning methods.Deep LearningDeep learning is a subfield of machine learning that utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers to achieve complex pattern recognition. These networks are particularly effective for tasks involving large amounts of data, such as image recognition and natural language processing.

Learning Algorithm: The learning algorithm is the main part of behind the model's ability to learn from data. It adjusts the parameters of the model's mathematical function iteratively during the training phase to minimize the difference between the model's prediction and the actual outcomes in the training data .Training Data: Training data is used to teach the model to make accurate predictions. It consists of input features(e.g variables, attributes) and corresponding output labels(in supervised learning) or is unalabeled(in supervised learning). During training , the model analyzes the patterns in the training data to update its parameters accordingly. Objective Function: The objective function, also known as the loss function, measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes in the training data. The goal during training is to minimize this function, effectively reducing the errors in the model's predictions.Optimization Process: Optimization is the process of finding the set of model parameters that minimize the objective function. This is typically achieved using optimization algorithms such as gradient descent, which iteratively adjusts the model's parameters in the direction that reduces the objective function.Generalization: Once the model is trained, it is evaluated on a separate set of data called the validation or test set to assess its performance on new, unseen data. The model's ability to perform well on data it hasn't seen before is known as generalization.Final Output: After training and validation, the model can be used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. This process, known as inference, involves applying the trained model to new input data to generate predictions or classifications.Advanced Machine Learning ModelsNeural Networks: You must have heard about deep neural network which helps solve complex problems of data. It is made up of interconnected nodes of multiple layers which we also call neurons. Many things have been successful from this model such as image recognition, NLP, and speech recognition.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): This is a type of model that is built in the framework of a neural network and it is made to handle data that are of symbolic type, like images. From this model, the hierarchy of spatial features can be determined.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): These can be used to process data that is sequentially ordered, such as reading categories or critical language. These networks are built with loops in their architectures that allow them to store information over time.Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs): LSTMs, which are a type of RNNs, recognize long-term correlation objects. These models do a good job of incorporating information organized into long categories.Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): GANs are a type of neural networks that generate data by studying two networks over time. A product generates network data, while a determination attempts to distinguish between real and fake samples.Transformer Models: This model become popular in natural language processing. These models process input data over time and capture long-range dependencies.Real-world examples of ML ModelsThe ML model uses predictive analysis to maintain the growth of various Industries-Financial Services: Banks and financial institutions are using machine learning models to provide better services to their customers.

This helps in understanding the marketing system and the products can be customized for their target customers. Future of Machine Learning ModelsThere are several important aspects to consider when considering the challenges and future of machine learning models. One challenge is that there are not enough resources and tools available to contextualize large data sets. Additionally, machine learning models need to be updated and restarted to understand new data patterns.In the future, another challenge for machine learning may be to collect and aggregate collections of data between different existing technology versions. This can be important for scientific development along with promoting the discovery of new possibilities. Finally, good strategy, proper resources, and technological advancement are important concepts for success in developing machine learning models. To address all these challenges, appropriate time and attention is required to further expand machine learning capabilities.ConclusionWe first saw the introduction of machine learning in which we know what a model is and what is the benefit of implementing it in our system.

Data science applications utilize technologies such as machine learning and the power of big data to develop deep insights and new capabilities, from predictive analytics to image and object recognition, conversational AI systems and beyond. Indeed, organizations that aren't adequately investing in data science likely will soon be left in the dust by competitors that are gaining significant competitive advantages by doing so. What exactly are data scientists doing that provides such transformative business benefits? The field of data science is a collection of a few key components: statistical and mathematical approaches for accurately extracting quantifiable data; technical and algorithmic approaches that facilitate working with large data sets, using advanced analytics techniques and methodologies that tackle data analysis from a scientific perspective; and engineering tools and methods that can help wrangle large amounts of data into the formats needed to derive high-quality insights. In this article, we'll dive deeper into common statistical and analytical techniques that data scientists use. Some of these data science techniques are rooted in centuries of mathematics and statistics work, while others are relatively new ones that take advantage of the latest research in machine learning, deep learning and other forms of advanced analytics.

How data science finds relationships between data When trying to identify information needles in data haystacks, data scientists, first, need to discern how different data elements correlate with or relate to each other. For example, if you have a bunch of data points plotted on a graph, how do you know if there's any meaning in them? The three types of statistical and analytical techniques most widely used by data scientists. Perhaps the data represents a relationship between two or more variables and the job is to plot some sort of line or multidimensional plane that best describes the relationship. Or perhaps it represents clustered groups that have some affinity. Other data could represent different categories. By finding these relationships, we give meaning to the otherwise randomness of the data, which can then be analyzed and visualized to provide information that organizations can use to make decisions or plan strategies. Now, let's look closer at the various data science techniques and methods that are available to perform the analysis. Classification techniques The primary question data scientists are looking to answer in classification problems is, "What category does this data belong to?" There are many reasons for classifying data into categories. Perhaps the data is an image of handwriting and you want to know what letter or number the image represents. Or perhaps the data represents loan applications and you want to know if it should be in the "approved" or "declined" category. Other classifications could be focused on determining patient treatments or whether an email message is spam. The algorithms and methods that data scientists use to filter data into categories include the following, among others: Decision trees. These are a branching logic structure that uses machine-generated trees of parameters and values to classify data into defined categories. Na ve Bayes classifiers. Using the power of probability, Bayes classifiers can help put data into simple categories. Support vector machines. SVMs aim to draw a line or plane with a wide margin to separate data into different categories. K-nearest neighbor. This technique uses a simple "lazy decision" method to identify what category a data point should belong to based on the categories of its nearest neighbors in a data set. Logistic regression. A classification technique despite its name, it uses the idea of fitting data to a line to distinguish between different categories on each side. The line is shaped such that data is shifted to one category or another rather than allowing more fluid correlations. Neural networks. This approach uses trained artificial neural networks, especially deep learning ones with multiple hidden layers. Neural nets have shown profound capabilities for classification with extremely large sets of training data. Regression techniques What if instead of trying to find out which category the data falls into, you'd like to know the relationship between different data points? The main idea of regression is to answer the question, "What is the predicted value for this data?" A simple concept that comes from the statistical idea of "regression to the mean," it can either be a straightforward regression between one independent and one dependent variable or a multidimensional one that tries to find the relationship between multiple variables. Some classification techniques, such as decision trees, SVMs and neural networks, can also be used to do regressions. In addition, the regression techniques available to data scientists include the following: Linear regression. One of the most widely used data science methods, this approach tries to find the line that best fits the data being analyzed based on the correlation between two variables. Lasso regression. Lasso, short for "least absolute shrinkage and selection operator," is a technique that improves upon the prediction accuracy of linear regression models by using a subset of data in a final model. Multivariate regression. This involves different ways to find lines or planes that fit multiple dimensions of data potentially containing many variables. Clustering and association analysis techniques Another set of data science techniques focuses on answering the question, "How does this data form into groups, and which groups do different data points belong to?" Data scientists can discover clusters of related data points that share various characteristics in common, which can yield useful information in analytics applications. The methods available for clustering uses include the following: K-means clustering. A k-means algorithm determines a certain number of clusters in a data set and finds the "centroids" that identify where different clusters are located, with data points assigned to the closest one. Mean-shift clustering. Another centroid-based clustering technique, it can be used separately or to improve on k-means clustering by shifting the designated centroids. DBSCAN. Short for "Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise," DBSCAN is another technique for discovering clusters that uses a more advanced method of identifying cluster densities. Gaussian mixture models. GMMs help find clusters by using a Gaussian distribution to group data together rather than treating the data as singular points. Hierarchical clustering. Similar to a decision tree, this technique uses a hierarchical, branching approach to find clusters. Association analysis is a related, but separate, technique. The main idea behind it is to find association rules that describe the commonality between different data points. Similar to clustering, we're looking to find groups that data belongs to. However, in this case, we're trying to determine when data points will occur together, rather than just identify clusters of them. In clustering, the goal is to segregate a large data set into identifiable groups, whereas with association analysis, we're measuring the degree of association between data points. Data science application examples The above methods and techniques in the data science tool belt need to be applied appropriately to specific analytics problems or questions and the data that's available to address them. Good data scientists must be able to understand the nature of the problem at hand -- is it clustering, classification or regression? -- and the best algorithmic approach that can yield the desired answers given the characteristics of the data. This is why data science is, in fact, a scientific process, rather than one that has hard and fast rules and allows you to just program your way to a solution. Using these techniques, data scientists can tackle a wide range of applications, many of which are commonly seen across different types of industries and organizations. Here are a few examples. Anomaly detection. If you can find the pattern for expected or "normal" data, then you can also find those data points that don't fit the pattern. Companies in industries as diverse as financial services, healthcare, retail and manufacturing regularly employ a variety of data science methods to identify anomalies in their data for uses such as fraud detection, customer analytics, cybersecurity and IT systems monitoring. Anomaly detection can also be used to eliminate outlier values from data sets for better analytics accuracy. Binary and multiclass classification. One primary application of classification techniques is to determine if something is or is not in a particular category. This is known as binary classification, because we could ask something like, "Is there a cat in the picture, or not?" A practical business application is to identify contracts or invoices among piles of documents using image recognition. In multiclass classification, we have many different categories in a data set and we're trying to find the best fit for data points. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does automated classification of workplace injuries. Personalization. Organizations looking to personalize interactions with people or recommend products and services to customers first need to group them into data buckets with shared characteristics. Effective data science work enables websites, marketing offers and more to be tailored to the specific needs and preferences of individuals, using technologies such as recommendation engines and hyper-personalization systems that are driven by matching the data in detailed profiles of people. That's just a sample of useful data science applications. By understanding the various techniques, methods, tools and analytical approaches, data scientists can help the organizations that employ them achieve the strategic and competitive benefits that many business rivals are already enjoying.

Each program has a specific use. Apache Spark is preferred for analyzing data over other types of programs for its ability to store computations into memory. The platform more quickly runs complicated algorithms, which is necessary when dealing with large data sets. By caching memory, scientists are less likely to lose valuable information. Hadoop is often used when data volumes exceed available memory. The platform is able to send data to different servers. Hadoop is also ideal for data exploration, filtration, sampling and summarization. Python is becoming a more and more popular programming language. The platform is useful for a variety of processes needed by data scientists. The language s versatility enables users to accomplish many different tasks that might include creating data sets or importing SQL tables. SQL is often required knowledge for data scientists to accomplish various functions that include adding, deleting or extracting information from databases. SQL also has the capability to perform analytical functions. By using the platform s precise commands, users are able to perform inquiries more quickly. (From Bootcamp.Berkeley.Edu) Data Science vs. Data Analytics Data science differs from data analytics in that it uses computer science skills (e.g., Python programming) and focuses on large and complex data repositories, where  complex  may refer to the modality of the data (images, time series, text, as well as traditional tabular data) or other facets of the data in question (data can be complex because they are geographically distributed, "unclean" or "unstructured", characterized by extensive missing or inaccurate values). Although occasionally used as an umbrella term for all aspects of data analysis (including data science), in a practical sense, traditional data analytics tends to focus on "simpler" and more straightforward data processes. For example, a data analytics team may work on the extraction of structured data from a database or repository, cleaning it, analyzing it with excel, and visualizing it in reports using Tableau, Power BI, Google Data Studio or other reporting tools. (From Rice University) Research About Big Data at Berkeley In 2021 three UC Berkeley Library/Research IT researchers explored the big data landscape at UC Berkeley.

Table of Contents Toggle 10+ Common Data Science Techniques to Know and Use 1. Descriptive Statistics Descriptive statistics lay the groundwork for any data analysis by providing a comprehensive summary of key features within a dataset. Mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation show how data is centred and spread. Knowing these stats is crucial for making smart decisions based on data patterns. Descriptive statistics, through graphical representations and summary metrics, allow data scientists to communicate complex information in a concise and comprehensible manner. Real-world applications range from summarising survey responses to assessing the distribution of product sales, making descriptive statistics an essential first step in any data analysis endeavour. How to Use Begin by collecting and cleaning data, ensuring its accuracy. Calculate basic metrics like mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation. Visualise data using histograms, box plots, or scatter plots for better understanding. Analyse results to identify trends, central tendencies, and outliers. 2. Inferential Statistics Inferential statistics takes data analysis a step further by drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample. Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals are fundamental components of inferential statistics, guiding researchers and analysts in making inferences about the broader context of the data. The application of inferential statistics extends to diverse fields, including healthcare, finance, and social sciences. Hypothesis testing means creating and testing ideas about a population measure, guiding decisions in uncertain situations. Meanwhile, confidence intervals provide a likely range for a population measure. These methods are priceless for decision-makers who want to apply sample insights to a bigger population. How to Use Formulate hypotheses, state significance levels, and collect data for inferential tests. Use statistical software for tests like t-test or chi-square. Analyse results, comparing p-values to the significance level, and draw conclusions about the population. Read More: Descriptive vs Inferential Statstics 3. Regression Analysis Regression analysis helps in predictive modelling by revealing connections between variables for accurate predictions. Linear regression handles continuous outcomes, while logistic regression deals with binary results, offering insights into factors impacting the dependent variable. Linear regression shows how independent and dependent variables relate through a fitted linear equation. Logistic regression, vital for predicting binary outcomes like customer purchases, aids data scientists in revealing patterns for informed decisions. How to Use Prepare and clean the dataset, select variables, and train a regression model. Evaluate its performance using metrics like MSE or R-squared. Apply the trained model to predict outcomes in new data. 4. Classification Algorithms In machine learning, classification algorithms categorise data into groups. Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes are potent tools for this task, applying to various real-world situations due to their versatility. Decision Trees, for instance, break down a dataset into smaller subsets, making decisions at each branch based on the input features. Random Forest, an ensemble learning technique, aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness. Naive Bayes, a probabilistic algorithm, proves beneficial in natural language processing and spam detection. Mastery of classification algorithms is essential for image recognition, sentiment analysis, and fraud detection. How to Use Clean and preprocess data, select relevant features, and split the dataset. Choose a classification algorithm (e.g., Decision Trees) and train the model. Evaluate its performance using accuracy, precision, and recall, and make predictions on new data. 5. Clustering Clustering techniques play a pivotal role in unsupervised learning, where the goal is to identify inherent patterns and group similar data points together. K-means and hierarchical clustering are widely used methods, each with its strengths and applications. Clustering is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the underlying structure of the data is not explicitly known. K-means clustering sorts data into clusters based on similarity. It s handy for things like customer grouping and pattern spotting. Hierarchical clustering, however, arranges data into a tree-like structure, revealing links between clusters. Clustering methods, from market segmentation to spotting oddities, are vital for finding patterns in messy data. How to Use Normalise data, choose a clustering algorithm, and determine the number of clusters. Assign data points to clusters and visualise results with scatter plots. Interpret the meaning of each cluster in the context of the problem. 6. Dimensionality Reduction As datasets grow in size and complexity, dimensionality reduction becomes essential for enhancing computational efficiency and improving model performance. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) are powerful techniques for reducing the number of features while retaining critical information. Principal Component Analysis finds key parts of data that capture the most variance. By keeping some of these parts, data experts can reduce dimensions without losing much info. On the flip side, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding is great for showing high-dimensional data in simpler spaces. These methods are key for dealing with too many dimensions, improving computer speed, and stopping machine learning models from fitting too closely. How to Use Standardise variables, choose a reduction technique (e.g., PCA), and apply it. Evaluate explained variance and integrate reduced data into machine learning models for efficiency. 7. Time Series Analysis Time series analysis is paramount when dealing with data points collected sequentially over time. This technique is crucial for tasks such as predicting stock prices, analysing weather patterns, and understanding user behaviour trends. Time series analysis involves understanding and modelling the temporal dependencies within the data, allowing for accurate predictions and informed decision-making. Moving averages, a common time series analysis technique, smooth out fluctuations in data by averaging values over a specified window. Autoregression models, on the other hand, capture the relationship between an observation and several lagged observations. These techniques are essential for extracting meaningful insights from time-dependent data, facilitating trend analysis, and improving forecasting accuracy. How to Use Prepare time-stamped data, visualise time series, and select appropriate models (e.g., ARIMA). Train, validate, and tune parameters. Make forecasts for future time points and evaluate predictions using metrics like MAE or RMSE. 8. Natural Language Processing (NLP) NLP is a specific area in data science dealing with computer-human language interaction. Techniques like tokenization, stemming, and sentiment analysis help extract insights from text, enabling various applications. Tokenization involves breaking down a text into individual words or phrases, facilitating subsequent analysis. Stemming aims to reduce words to their root form, simplifying the analysis of word frequency and patterns. Sentiment analysis, another crucial NLP technique, determines the emotional tone of a piece of text, making it invaluable for understanding customer feedback, social media sentiment, and more. NLP is at the forefront of language-related tasks, influencing applications such as chatbots, language translation, and content categorization. How to Use Clean and preprocess text data, tokenize, and use stemming or lemmatization. Extract features using techniques like TF-IDF. Choose an NLP algorithm, train and evaluate it on labelled data, and extract insights from textual data. 9. Neural Networks Deep learning, based on the intricate design of the human brain, relies on neural networks. Feedforward, recurrent, and convolutional networks excel in tasks such as image recognition, speech processing, and language translation. Understanding neural networks is fundamental for delving into the world of deep learning, where hierarchical layers of interconnected nodes process and transform input data. Feedforward neural networks, the simplest form of neural networks, consist of input, hidden, and output layers, with information flowing in one direction. Recurrent neural networks introduce loops to allow information persistence, making them suitable for sequential data. Optimised for image tasks, convolutional neural networks employ convolutional layers to spot patterns. Neural networks lead AI progress, advancing computer vision, language understanding, and intricate pattern recognition. How to Use Clean and preprocess text data, tokenize, and use stemming or lemmatization. Extract features using techniques like TF-IDF. Choose an NLP algorithm, train and evaluate it on labelled data, and extract insights from textual data. 10. Ensemble Learning Ensemble learning combines the predictions of multiple models to create a more robust and accurate predictive model. Techniques such as bagging, boosting, and stacking leverage the diversity of individual models to mitigate overfitting and enhance predictive performance. Ensemble learning has proven effective in various applications, from healthcare diagnostics to financial forecasting. Bagging, short for bootstrap aggregating, involves training multiple models on different subsets of the training data and aggregating their predictions.

This phase involves cleaning raw data, handling missing values, and transforming variables to create a suitable input for machine learning models. Techniques such as normalisation, encoding, and feature scaling are essential for ensuring that the data is in a format conducive to accurate model training. Handling missing data involves strategies such as imputation or removal of missing values, depending on the context and impact on the analysis. Normalisation and feature scaling standardise the range of variables, preventing certain features from dominating the modelling process. Transforming non-numeric data into numbers, encoding categorical variables allows machine learning algorithms to process information efficiently. Data preprocessing is vital in the data science pipeline, ensuring clean, relevant data ready for analysis. How to Use Clean data by handling missing values, normalise numerical features, encode categorical variables, perform feature engineering, and split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation. 13. A/B Testing A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a powerful technique for optimising decisions by comparing two versions of a variable to determine which performs better. Whether it s testing different versions of a website, marketing emails, or product features, A/B testing provides a systematic approach to decision-making and continuous improvement based on real-time feedback. The A/B testing process typically involves selecting a metric to measure, randomly assigning users to different groups, implementing the changes in one group (A) while maintaining the status quo in the other group (B), and analysing the performance based on the chosen metric. By comparing the outcomes of the two groups, data scientists can identify which version leads to better results, informing decisions and strategies with empirical evidence. How to Use Define objectives, identify variables, randomly assign groups, implement changes, collect data, analyse results statistically, and draw conclusions about implementing or rejecting changes. 14. Data Visualization Data visualisation is the art of representing data visually, making complex information more accessible and understandable.

Data Science Techniques Examples Descriptive Statistics Mean, Median, Mode Descriptive statistics provide a summary of the main aspects of a dataset. The mean, median, and mode are measures of central tendency that help understand the typical value in a set of data. The mean is the average, the median is the middle value, and the mode is the most frequently occurring value. For instance, in a dataset of sales figures, calculating the mean provides an overview of the average sales, while the median offers insight into the middle point, mitigating the impact of outliers. Variance and Standard Deviation Variance and standard deviation quantify the spread or dispersion of data. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation implies that the values are more spread out. These measures are invaluable in understanding the variability within a dataset, critical for making predictions and drawing conclusions. Regression Analysis Simple Linear Regression Regression analysis models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Simple linear regression involves predicting a dependent variable using a single independent variable. For instance, in a real estate context, one might use simple linear regression to predict house prices based on the square footage of the property.

But remember, they re only human!Susan OrleanFollow5 min read Jul 6, 2022--18SharePhoto by Marten Newhall on UnsplashMy toughest interview ever was with a dog named Biff, whom I had decided to profile for the New Yorker. I persuaded his owners that I needed time alone with the dog so I could really get a feel for his personality, so they left us for an hour or two. It only took me a minute to realize the futility of my task, since, obviously, dogs don t talk.But most of the time your research will pair you up in conversation with human beings. Then your real troubles begin. How do you engage a perfect stranger in a meaningful and authentic way, in, say, an hour or less? How do you steer them into providing you with pithy, revealing, interesting quotes? How do not feel like a complete jerk, sitting there with your pen and notebook?Mastering the art of the interview is critical if you hope to write nonfiction, and undoubtedly useful with fiction, too. Whether you re interviewing someone who is primary to your story (whom you probably will quote) or interviewing someone for background information, you need to do it well, or you re going to have a lot of difficulty writing a strong piece. Obviously, each interviewer and interviewee is different, but I think certain rules apply to everyone.You ve heard this a million times before, but it FollowWritten by Susan Orlean88K followers 465 followingStaff writer, The New Yorker.

If talking to people is anxiety-inducing or difficult for you, the good news is that it s totally possible to get better at it, and it doesn t have to be a painful process. Just by making some simple changes to the way you approach others and carry on conversations, you ll start to notice that talking to people feels more natural and even enjoyable! We ll show you some easy ways to strike up conversations, keep them going, and make people feel at ease with your body language. Things You Should Know Start up a conversation with a new person by chatting about something you have in common. Offer a simple greeting or question to start a conversation rather than saying something clever. Ask open-ended questions that require the other person to give a detailed answer. Practice positive body language when you speak to others, like smiling, making eye contact, and nodding at the right time. Steps Part 1 Part 1 of 3: Starting a Conversation Download Article 1 Talk to a new person. Sometimes the hardest part of talking to people is figuring out how to start the conversation. This can be particularly intimidating when you want to talk to someone that you have not previously met. To strike up a conversation with a new person, try to find some common ground.[1] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For example, if you are waiting in line at your neighborhood coffee shop, you could say to the person in front of you, "What's good here? I've never tried any of their specialty drinks." You can also comment on the situation. Try saying, "Isn't it nice out today?". If the person responds in a favorable tone, you can follow up with some more specific comments. Another conversation starter is making a comment about the person you want to talk to. You could say, "I really love that bag you're carrying." 2 Choose the right person to approach. Look for someone who is not otherwise occupied and has a friendly expression. For example, if you are standing in line and someone makes eye contact with you, offer a smile and an opening question. Avoid trying to start a conversation with someone who is speaking to someone else or who is actively engaged in a task.[2] X Research source At a party, a good place to start a conversation is near the food table or bar. These things provide natural conversation starters, such as "Have you tried the spinach dip?" or "Can you show me how to use this wine opener?" If you are having trouble mingling at a party, head towards the kitchen. This is often a gathering space, and you can join in the crowd by helping to mix drinks or set out snacks. The same rules apply when deciding when to approach a co-worker. Wait until they are not obviously engaged with someone else. Lunch is an ideal time to start a conversation.

One effective approach is to ask that person something about themselves. Questions are a great way to get the conversational ball rolling.[3] X Research source If you want to chat to a colleague in the cafeteria, questions are a good way to start. Try saying, "How was your weekend? Did you take advantage of the great weather?" Maybe you'd like to get to know your new next door neighbor. When you see her grabbing her mail, say, "How are you adjusting to your new neighborhood? Let me know if I can recommend a good pizza place." 4 Keep it simple. You don't have to have a great opening line in order to start talking to someone. You can start by saying something as basic as "Hi" or "How are you?". The other person will often take it from there and keep the conversation going.[4] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source You can make a simple statement about yourself. After a challenging spinning class, say to the person next to you, "Wow, I'm going to be sore later." By keeping things simple, you are starting the conversation, but allowing the other person to help you get things started. It also takes some of the pressure off of you to find something clever to say. Reader Poll: We asked 163 wikiHow readers, and 48% agreed that the best way to start a conversation when introducing yourself to someone at a party is to compliment something they are wearing.

Focus instead on having relaxed conversations. Eventually, you might even start having fun! 5 Avoid over-sharing. When you are trying to start a conversation, it is important that you do not make the other person feel awkward. Many people have a tendency to babble or chat nervously when making small talk. This can lead to a common social problem known as over-sharing.[5] X Research source Unless you are talking privately to someone you know well, it's best to avoid sharing sensitive information about yourself. For example, don't try to start a conversation by telling a casual acquaintance the results of your most recent checkup at your gynecologists office. People often feel uncomfortable when you share personal information. The cashier at the grocery store likely does not want to hear that your teenage daughter is not performing well at school. When you are starting a conversation, stay away from potentially sensitive subjects. Don't monologue at people good conversations are dialogues with questions and anecdotes.[6] X Expert Source Cristina MoraraDating Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. 6 Know when not to talk. Sometimes silence can feel awkward. Your natural inclination might be to fill that silence with chit chat. However, there are times that it is best to stay silent.[7] X Research source If you are bored on an airplane, you might want to entertain yourself by talking to your seatmate. But if she is giving you certain social cues, find another way to amuse yourself. If someone is avoiding making eye contact, that is a sign she doesn't feel like talking. Someone who is reading or listening to headphones is probably also content to remain silent. Advertisement Part 2 Part 2 of 3: Continuing the Dialogue Download Article 1 Ask questions. Once you have broken the ice, there are several things you can do to keep the conversation going. Asking questions is a great way to continue the dialogue. Try asking the other person to do something simple for you.[8] X Research source For example, if you are picking your child up at school, you can say to another mom, "Can you remind me what time the early dismissal is tomorrow?" You could ask your colleague to offer you some advice. Consider saying, "Brad, your Powerpoints always look so polished. Would you mind offering me some tips?" If you're on a date, you could ask something like "what are some of your pet peeves?" or "what's something people would be surprised to learn about you?"[9] X Expert Source Cristina MoraraDating Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. 2 Continue with open-ended questions. Asking any question is a great way to get the conversation going. But open-ended questions are the key to keeping the chat flowing. Ask questions that require much more than a yes or no answer.[10] X Research source Instead of saying, "How was your trip to Phoenix?" try saying, "I remember you saying you were traveling. What sorts of things did you do on your vacation?" This will allow for elaboration. Continue asking questions after the initial response. If the person says, "We did a lot of golfing", you can say, "Oh, what's your handicap? Can you recommend any good courses? I'd love to improve my game." You can also turn compliments into questions. For example, you could say, "I really love that dress you're wearing. How do you find such great pieces?" Asking people "what were you like in high school?" can lead to some surprisingly fun and interesting responses.[11] X Expert Source Cristina MoraraDating Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. 3 Be genuine. Don't try to force a conversation. Instead, try talking about something that you genuinely care about. If you are feigning interest, it will usually be evident.[12] X Research source At a dinner party, strike up a conversation with someone who shares your interest. For example, you could say, "Mike, I hear you just got a new bike. I love going on trail rides." When you are at your daughter's soccer game, try talking to another parent about the new coach. For instance, "I feel like Haley is responding well to the extra practice time. How's Mary handling it?" 4 Avoid conversation killers. After you have been chatting for a few moments, you might feel more comfortable with how the conversation is going. But you still need to make an effort to make the conversation flow smoothly. Part of being a good conversationalist is knowing how to avoid saying things that will make the other person uncomfortable.[13] X Research source You've probably heard the old adage that you should avoid talking about politics or religion in social settings. You should heed that advice when you are in a diverse group of people. Avoid boring people. For example, don't give long, intricate summaries of your favorite reality show or your cat's health. Give others a chance to participate in the conversation. Strike the right tone. For the most part, small talk should be happy. After all, you are looking to make someone like you. And we are all naturally drawn to positive people. When in doubt, try to look for something upbeat to say.[14] X Research source For instance, you could say, "Wow, we've had a lot of rain lately. But at least we're likely to have some gorgeous spring flowers!" It's ok to commiserate about an uncomfortable situation. Just try to put a positive spin on it. For example, "Bummer we're stuck working late tonight. Want to grab a late dinner? I know a great pizza place." 5 Shift topics. During most conversations that last longer than a few minutes, you will probably cover more than one subject. Be prepared to move on to something other than your ice breaking question. A good way to be prepared is to pay attention to current events and pop culture. You'll always be able to offer observations about those things. For example, you could say, "Did you see any of the movies up for Best Picture this year? I really loved Spotlight." Be ready to transition to new topics. Try saying things such as, "Oh, your story reminds me of my trip to Greece. Have you ever been there?" This tactic will help the conversation flow naturally. 6 Reach out to other people. The more people that are involved in a conversation, the less pressure there is on you. Take steps to involve others in your group. For example, if you are eating in the cafeteria at work, reach out to your coworker who is looking for a place to sit. Say, "Hey, Lucy, would you like to join Tim and I?"[15] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source You can also do this in social situations. Maybe you are making small talk with an acquaintance at a cocktail party. If you see someone standing alone nearby, draw them into your circle. Say, "Wow, this shrimp is fabulous. Have you had a chance to try it yet?" Drawing others in to your conversation is not only polite, but it can help keep the conversation moving along. The more people that are involved, the more you will find to talk about. 7 Be a good listener. Listening is just as important as talking. To become a good conversationalist, you need to practice active listening. You can verbally indicate that you are listening and engaged.[16] X Research source Try offering neutral comments such as "That's interesting." You can also say, "Tell me more" to encourage the other person to continue with the story. You can use a method called echoing to demonstrate that you are listening. Say, "Wow, that is amazing that you have traveled to every single country in Europe." Advertisement Part 3 Part 3 of 3: Using Positive Body Language Download Article 1 Smile. When you are having a conversation, your body language can be just as important as the words you say. One of the most effective ways to communicate is to offer someone a smile. This is an especially great way to connect with someone you don't know very well.[17] X Research source Smile at someone at the dog park. If you notice your dogs are playing together well, grin over at that poodle's owner. It makes you seem approachable. Smiling is also an effective way to indicate support. If one of your co-workers stops by your desk to tell you a story, smiling at her indicates that you are interested in what she is saying. 2 Make eye contact. While you are speaking to someone, it is important to look them in the eye. This demonstrates that you are engaged in the conversation. It also indicates that you are listening and respectful of what is being said.[18] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Eye contact also helps you gauge the other person's reactions. Eyes reflect people's emotions, such as boredom, anger, or affection. Don't stare at people. It is not necessary to focus entirely on your friend's eyes. You can let your gaze naturally take in your surroundings, too. 3 Nod your head. A simple head nod is one of the most effective non-verbal cues you can use. Nodding your head can indicate multiple things. It tells someone that you understand what they are saying, for example.[19] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Nodding your head also demonstrates that you agree. It is also a way to show support for what is being said. Avoid being a bobble-head. Do not nod continuously, as that will negate the genuineness of the gesture. 4 Build your confidence. Your body language often reflects nerves or anxiety. It can be intimidating to talk to people, especially if you are shy. One of the best ways to increase your conversation confidence is to be prepared for multiple scenarios. For instance, if you know you are going to see meet new people at a party, have some topics of conversation ready to talk about.[20] X Research source If you're going to a birthday party that involves bowling, be ready to tell a funny anecdote about the time you joined a couples bowling league. Practice your skills. Challenge yourself to talk to someone new each day. It can be someone on the street or someone at school. Practice starting and continuing conversations. Confidence is key when approaching a romantic interest. Once you've found an opening line that works for you, try it out on the person you like. For example, you could say, "The music during spin class always makes me feel like dancing. Do you know anywhere good around here to listen to live music?" Say this with a smile and eye contact.

For other uses, see Human (disambiguation), Mankind (disambiguation), Humankind (disambiguation), Human Race (disambiguation), Human Being (disambiguation), and Homo sapiens (disambiguation). Not to be confused with Person. HumanTemporal range: 0.3 0 Ma Pre    O S D C P T J K Pg N   Chibanian   present Male (left) and female (right) adult humans Scientific classification Domain: Eukaryota Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Primates Suborder: Haplorhini Infraorder: Simiiformes Family: Hominidae Subfamily: Homininae Tribe: Hominini Genus: Homo Species: H. sapiens Binomial name Homo sapiensLinnaeus, 1758 Homo sapiens population density (2020) Humans (Homo sapiens) or modern humans are the most common and widespread species of primate, and the last surviving species of the genus Homo. They are great apes characterized by their hairlessness, bipedalism, and high intelligence. Humans have large brains, enabling more advanced cognitive skills that facilitate successful adaptation to varied environments, development of sophisticated tools, and formation of complex social structures and civilizations. Humans are highly social, with individual humans tending to belong to a multi-layered network of distinct social groups   from families and peer groups to corporations and political states. As such, social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, languages, and traditions (collectively termed institutions), each of which bolsters human society. Humans are also highly curious: the desire to understand and influence phenomena has motivated humanity's development of science, technology, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other frameworks of knowledge; humans also study themselves through such domains as anthropology, social science, history, psychology, and medicine. As of 2025, there are estimated to be more than 8 billion humans alive. For most of their history, humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000 60,000 years ago. The Neolithic Revolution occurred independently in multiple locations, the earliest in Southwest Asia 13,000 years ago, and saw the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement; in turn, this led to the development of civilization and kickstarted a period of continuous (and ongoing) population growth and rapid technological change. Since then, a number of civilizations have risen and fallen, while a number of sociocultural and technological developments have resulted in significant changes to the human lifestyle. Humans are omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material, and have used fire and other forms of heat to prepare and cook food since the time of Homo erectus. Humans are generally diurnal, sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day. Humans have had a dramatic effect on the environment. They are apex predators, being rarely preyed upon by other species.[1] Human population growth, industrialization, land development, overconsumption and combustion of fossil fuels have led to environmental destruction and pollution that significantly contributes to the ongoing mass extinction of other forms of life.[2][3] Within the last century, humans have explored challenging environments such as Antarctica, the deep sea, and outer space, though human habitation in these environments is typically limited in duration and restricted to scientific, military, or industrial expeditions. Humans have visited the Moon and sent human-made spacecraft to other celestial bodies. Although the term "humans" technically equates with all members of the genus Homo, in common usage it generally refers to Homo sapiens, the only extant member. All other members of the genus Homo, which are now extinct, are known as archaic humans, and the term "modern human" is used to distinguish Homo sapiens from archaic humans. Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis or a similar species. Migrating out of Africa, they gradually replaced and interbred with local populations of archaic humans. Multiple hypotheses for the extinction of archaic human species such as Neanderthals include competition, violence, interbreeding with Homo sapiens, or inability to adapt to climate change. Genes and the environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility, mental abilities, body size, and life span. Though humans vary in many traits (such as genetic predispositions and physical features), humans are among the least genetically diverse primates. Any two humans are at least 99% genetically similar. Humans are sexually dimorphic: generally, males have greater body strength and females have a higher body fat percentage. At puberty, humans develop secondary sex characteristics. Females are capable of pregnancy, usually between puberty, at around 12 years old, and menopause, around the age of 50. Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death. Often, both the mother and the father provide care for their children, who are helpless at birth. Etymology and definition Further information: Names for the human species and Human taxonomy Carl Linnaeus coined the name Homo sapiens All modern humans are classified into the species Homo sapiens, coined by Carl Linnaeus in his 1735 work Systema Naturae.[4] The generic name Homo is a learned 18th-century derivation from Latin hom , which refers to humans of either sex.[5][6] The word human can refer to all members of the Homo genus.[7] The name Homo sapiens means 'wise man' or 'knowledgeable man'.[8] There is disagreement if certain extinct members of the genus, namely Neanderthals, should be included as a separate species of humans or as a subspecies of H. sapiens.[7] Human is a loanword of Middle English from Old French humain, ultimately from Latin h m nus, the adjectival form of hom  ('man'   in the sense of humanity).[9] The native English term man can refer to the species generally (a synonym for humanity) as well as to human males. It may also refer to individuals of either sex.[10] Despite the fact that the word animal is colloquially used as an antonym for human,[11] and contrary to a common biological misconception, humans are animals.[12] The word person is often used interchangeably with human, but philosophical debate exists as to whether personhood applies to all humans or all sentient beings, and further if a human can lose personhood (such as by going into a persistent vegetative state).[13] Evolution Main article: Human evolution Humans are apes (superfamily Hominoidea).[14] The lineage of apes that eventually gave rise to humans first split from gibbons (family Hylobatidae), next orangutans (genus Pongo), then gorillas (genus Gorilla), and finally, chimpanzees and bonobos (genus Pan). The last split, between the human and chimpanzee bonobo lineages, took place around 8 4 million years ago, in the late Miocene epoch.[15][16] During this split, chromosome 2 was formed from the joining of two other chromosomes, leaving humans with only 23 pairs of chromosomes, compared to 24 for the other apes.[17] Following their split with chimpanzees and bonobos, the hominins diversified into many species and at least two distinct genera. All but one of these lineages   representing the genus Homo and its sole extant species Homo sapiens   are now extinct.[18] Reconstruction of Lucy, the first Australopithecus afarensis skeleton found The genus Homo evolved from Australopithecus.[19][20] Though fossils from the transition are scarce, the earliest members of Homo share several key traits with Australopithecus.[21][22] Due to the scant available evidence dating the time of divergence to the genus Homo does not have a consensus,[23] Some studies using molecular clock techniques estimate the Homo genus appeared 4.30 2.56 million years ago,[24] while others contest that some early Homo species are incorrectly included in the genus and therefor put this estimate at about 1.87 million years ago.[23] The earliest record of Homo is the 2.8 million-year-old specimen LD 350-1 from Ethiopia, and the earliest named species are Homo habilis and Homo rudolfensis which evolved by 2.3 million years ago.[22] H. erectus (the African variant is sometimes called H. ergaster) evolved 2 million years ago and was the first archaic human species to leave Africa and disperse across Eurasia.[25] H. erectus also was the first to evolve a characteristically human body plan. Homo sapiens emerged in Africa around 300,000 years ago from a species commonly designated as either H. heidelbergensis or H. rhodesiensis, the descendants of H. erectus that remained in Africa.[26] H. sapiens migrated out of the continent, gradually replacing or interbreeding with local populations of archaic humans.[27][28][29] Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000 70,000 years ago,[30] and possibly earlier.[31] This development was likely selected amidst natural climate change in Middle to Late Pleistocene Africa.[32] The "out of Africa" migration took place in at least two waves, the first around 130,000 to 100,000 years ago, the second (Southern Dispersal) around 70,000 to 50,000 years ago.[33][34] H. sapiens proceeded to colonize all the continents and larger islands, arriving in Eurasia 125,000 years ago,[35][36] Australia around 65,000 years ago,[37] the Americas around 15,000 years ago, and remote islands such as Hawaii, Easter Island, Madagascar, and New Zealand in the years 300 to 1280 CE.[38][39] Human evolution was not a simple linear or branched progression but involved interbreeding between related species.[40][41][42] Genomic research has shown that hybridization between substantially diverged lineages was common in human evolution.[43] DNA evidence suggests that several genes of Neanderthal origin are present among all non sub-Saharan-African populations, and Neanderthals and other hominins, such as Denisovans, may have contributed up to 6% of their genome to present-day non sub-Saharan-African humans.[40][44][45] Human evolution is characterized by a number of morphological, developmental, physiological, and behavioral changes that have taken place since the split between the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. The most significant of these adaptations are hairlessness,[46] obligate bipedalism, increased brain size and decreased sexual dimorphism (neoteny). The relationship between all these changes is the subject of ongoing debate.[47] Hominoidea (hominoids, apes) Hylobatidae (gibbons) Hominidae (hominids, great apes) Ponginae Pongo (orangutans) Pongo abelii Pongo tapanuliensis Pongo pygmaeus Homininae (hominines) Gorillini Gorilla (gorillas) Gorilla gorilla Gorilla beringei Hominini (hominins) Panina Pan (chimpanzees) Pan troglodytes Pan paniscus Hominina (homininans) Homo sapiens (humans) History Main article: Human history Prehistory Main article: Prehistory Overview of the peopling of the world by early human migration during the Upper Paleolithic, following the Southern Dispersal paradigm Until about 12,000 years ago, all humans lived as hunter-gatherers.[48][49] The Neolithic Revolution (the invention of agriculture) first took place in Southwest Asia and spread through large parts of the Old World over the following millennia.[50] It also occurred independently in Mesoamerica (about 6,000 years ago),[51] China,[52][53] Papua New Guinea,[54] and the Sahel and West Savanna regions of Africa.[55][56][57] Access to food surplus led to the formation of permanent human settlements, the domestication of animals and the use of metal tools for the first time in history. Agriculture and sedentary lifestyle led to the emergence of early civilizations.[58][59][60] Ancient Main article: Ancient history Great Pyramids of Giza, Egypt An urban revolution took place in the 4th millennium BCE with the development of city-states, particularly Sumerian cities located in Mesopotamia.[61] It was in these cities that the earliest known form of writing, cuneiform script, appeared around 3000 BCE.[62] Other major civilizations to develop around this time were Ancient Egypt and the Indus Valley Civilisation.[63] They eventually traded with each other and invented technology such as wheels, plows and sails.[64][65][66][67] Emerging by 3000 BCE, the Caral Supe civilization is the oldest complex civilization in the Americas.[68] Astronomy and mathematics were also developed and the Great Pyramid of Giza was built.[69][70][71] There is evidence of a severe drought lasting about a hundred years that may have caused the decline of these civilizations,[72] with new ones appearing in the aftermath. Babylonians came to dominate Mesopotamia while others,[73] such as the Poverty Point culture, Minoans and the Shang dynasty, rose to prominence in new areas.[74][75][76] The Late Bronze Age collapse around 1200 BCE resulted in the disappearance of a number of civilizations and the beginning of the Greek Dark Ages.[77][78] During this period iron started replacing bronze, leading to the Iron Age.[79] In the 5th century BCE, history started being recorded as a discipline, which provided a much clearer picture of life at the time.[80] Between the 8th and 6th century BCE, Europe entered the classical antiquity age, a period when ancient Greece and ancient Rome flourished.[81][82] Around this time other civilizations also came to prominence. The Maya civilization started to build cities and create complex calendars.[83][84] In Africa, the Kingdom of Aksum overtook the declining Kingdom of Kush and facilitated trade between India and the Mediterranean.[85] In West Asia, the Achaemenid Empire's system of centralized governance became the precursor to many later empires,[86] while the Gupta Empire in India and the Han dynasty in China have been described as golden ages in their respective regions.[87][88] Medieval Main article: Post-classical history Medieval French manuscript illustration of the three classes of medieval society from the 13th-century Li Livres dou Sant  Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, Europe entered the Middle Ages.[89] During this period, Christianity and the Church would provide centralized authority and education.[90] In the Middle East, Islam became the prominent religion and expanded into North Africa. It led to an Islamic Golden Age, inspiring achievements in architecture, the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life.[91][92] The Christian and Islamic worlds would eventually clash, with the Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire declaring a series of holy wars to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims.[93] In the Americas, between 200 and 900 CE Mesoamerica was in its Classic Period,[94] while further north, complex Mississippian societies would arise starting around 800 CE.[95] The Mongol Empire would conquer much of Eurasia in the 13th and 14th centuries.[96] Over this same time period, the Mali Empire in Africa grew to be the largest empire on the continent, stretching from Senegambia to Ivory Coast.[97] Oceania would see the rise of the Tu i Tonga Empire which expanded across many islands in the South Pacific.[98] By the late 15th century, the Aztecs and Inca had become the dominant power in Mesoamerica and the Andes, respectively.[99] Modern Main articles: Early modern period and Late modern period James Watt's steam engine The early modern period in Europe and the Near East (c. 1450 1800) began with the final defeat of the Byzantine Empire, and the rise of the Ottoman Empire.[100] Meanwhile, Japan entered the Edo period,[101] the Qing dynasty rose in China[102] and the Mughal Empire ruled much of India.[103] Europe underwent the Renaissance, starting in the 15th century,[104] and the Age of Discovery began with the exploring and colonizing of new regions.[105] This included the colonization of the Americas[106] and the Columbian Exchange.[107] This expansion led to the Atlantic slave trade[108] and the genocide of the Americas' indigenous peoples.[109] This period also marked the Scientific Revolution, with great advances in mathematics, mechanics, astronomy and physiology.[110] The late modern period (1800 present) saw the Technological and Industrial Revolution bring such discoveries as imaging technology, major innovations in transport and energy development.[111] Influenced by Enlightenment ideals, the Americas and Europe experienced a period of political revolutions known as the Age of Revolution.[112] The Napoleonic Wars raged through Europe in the early 1800s,[113] Spain lost most of its colonies in the New World,[114] while Europeans continued expansion into Africa   where European control went from 10% to almost 90% in less than 50 years[115]   and Oceania.[116] In the 19th century, the British Empire expanded to become the world's largest empire.[117]A laptop connected to the Internet.A tenuous balance of power among European nations collapsed in 1914 with the outbreak of the First World War, one of the deadliest conflicts in history.[118] In the 1930s, a worldwide economic crisis led to the rise of authoritarian regimes and a Second World War, involving almost all of the world's countries.[119] The war's destruction led to the collapse of most global empires, leading to widespread decolonization. Following the conclusion of the Second World War in 1945, the United States[120] and the Soviet Union emerged as the remaining global superpowers. This led to a Cold War that saw a struggle for global influence, including a nuclear arms race and a space race, ending in the collapse of the Soviet Union.[121][122] The current Information Age, spurred by the development of the Internet and artificial intelligence systems, sees the world becoming increasingly globalized and interconnected.[123] Habitat and population Further information: Human geography and Demography Population statistics[n 1] Choropleth map showing Population density (people per square kilometer) estimates by 30 arc-second grid in 2020World population8.1 billionPopulation density16/km2 (41/sq mi) by total area55/km2 (142/sq mi) by land areaLargest cities[n 2]Tokyo, Delhi, Shanghai, S o Paulo, Mexico City, Cairo, Mumbai, Beijing, Dhaka, Osaka Early human settlements were dependent on proximity to water and   depending on the lifestyle   other natural resources used for subsistence, such as populations of animal prey for hunting and arable land for growing crops and grazing livestock.[127] Modern humans, however, have a great capacity for altering their habitats by means of technology, irrigation, urban planning, construction, deforestation and desertification.[128] Human settlements continue to be vulnerable to natural disasters, especially those placed in hazardous locations and with low quality of construction.[129] Grouping and deliberate habitat alteration is often done with the goals of providing protection, accumulating comforts or material wealth, expanding the available food, improving aesthetics, increasing knowledge or enhancing the exchange of resources.[130] Humans are one of the most adaptable species, despite having a low or narrow tolerance for many of the earth's extreme environments.[131] Currently the species is present in all eight biogeographical realms, although their presence in the Antarctic realm is very limited to research stations and annually there is a population decline in the winter months of this realm. Humans established nation-states in the other seven realms, such as South Africa, India, Russia, Australia, Fiji, the United States, and Brazil (each located in a different biogeographical realm). Within the last century, humans have also explored the deep sea and outer space. Human habitation within these hostile environments is restrictive and expensive, typically limited in duration, and restricted to scientific, military, or industrial expeditions.[132] Humans have visited the Moon and made their presence known on other celestial bodies through human-made robotic spacecraft.[133][134][135] Since 2000, there has been continuous human presence in space through habitation on the International Space Station.[136] By using advanced tools and clothing, humans have been able to extend their tolerance to a wide variety of temperatures, humidities, and altitudes.[131][137] As a result, humans are a cosmopolitan species found in almost all regions of the world, including tropical rainforest, arid desert, extremely cold arctic regions, and heavily polluted cities; in comparison, most other species are confined to a few geographical areas by their limited adaptability.[138] The human population is not, however, uniformly distributed on the Earth's surface, because the population density varies from one region to another, and large stretches of surface are almost completely uninhabited, like Antarctica and vast swathes of the ocean.[131][139] Most humans (61%) live in Asia; the remainder live in the Americas (14%), Africa (14%), Europe (11%), and Oceania (0.5%).[140] Humans and their domesticated animals represent 96% of all mammalian biomass on earth, whereas all wild mammals represent only 4%.[141] Estimates of the population at the time agriculture emerged in around 10,000 BC have ranged between 1 million and 15 million.[142][143] Around 50 60 million people lived in the combined eastern and western Roman Empire in the 4th century AD.[144] Bubonic plagues, first recorded in the 6th century AD, reduced the population by 50%, with the Black Death killing 75 200 million people in Eurasia and North Africa alone.[145] Human population is believed to have reached one billion in 1800. It has since then increased exponentially, reaching two billion in 1930 and three billion in 1960, four in 1975, five in 1987 and six billion in 1999.[146] It passed seven billion in 2011[147] and passed eight billion in November 2022.[148] It took over two million years of human prehistory and history for the human population to reach one billion and only 207 years more to grow to 7 billion.[149] The combined biomass of the carbon of all the humans on Earth in 2018 was estimated at 60 million tons, about 10 times larger than that of all non-domesticated mammals.[141] In 2018, 4.2 billion humans (55%) lived in urban areas, up from 751 million in 1950.[150] The most urbanized regions are Northern America (82%), Latin America (81%), Europe (74%) and Oceania (68%), with Africa and Asia having nearly 90% of the world's 3.4 billion rural population.[150] Problems for humans living in cities include various forms of pollution and crime,[151] especially in inner city and suburban slums. Biology Anatomy and physiology Main article: Human body Basic anatomical features of female and male humans. These models have had body hair and male facial hair removed and head hair trimmed. Most aspects of human physiology are closely homologous to corresponding aspects of animal physiology. The dental formula of humans is: 2.1.2.32.1.2.3. Humans have proportionately shorter palates and much smaller teeth than other primates. They are the only primates to have short, relatively flush canine teeth. Humans have characteristically crowded teeth, with gaps from lost teeth usually closing up quickly in young individuals. Humans are gradually losing their third molars, with some individuals having them congenitally absent.[152] Humans share with chimpanzees a vestigial tail,[153] appendix, flexible shoulder joints, grasping fingers and opposable thumbs.[154] Humans also have a more barrel-shaped chest in contrast to the funnel shape of other apes, an adaptation for bipedal respiration.[155] Apart from bipedalism and brain size, humans differ from chimpanzees mostly in smelling, hearing and digesting proteins.[156] While humans have a density of hair follicles comparable to other apes, it is predominantly vellus hair, most of which is so short and wispy as to be practically invisible.[157][158] Humans have about 2 million sweat glands spread over their entire bodies, many more than chimpanzees, whose sweat glands are scarce and are mainly located on the palm of the hand and on the soles of the feet.[159] It is estimated that the worldwide average height for an adult human male is about 171 cm (5 ft 7 in), while the worldwide average height for adult human females is about 159 cm (5 ft 3 in).[160] Shrinkage of stature may begin in middle age in some individuals but tends to be typical in the extremely aged.[161] Throughout history, human populations have universally become taller, probably as a consequence of better nutrition, healthcare, and living conditions.[162] The average mass of an adult human is 59 kg (130 lb) for females and 77 kg (170 lb) for males.[163][164] Like many other conditions, body weight and body type are influenced by both genetic susceptibility and environment and varies greatly among individuals.[165][166] Humans have a far faster and more accurate throw than other animals.[167] Humans are also among the best long-distance runners in the animal kingdom, but slower over short distances.[168][156] Humans' thinner body hair and more productive sweat glands help avoid heat exhaustion while running for long distances.[169] Compared to other apes, the human heart produces greater stroke volume and cardiac output and the aorta is proportionately larger.[170][171] Genetics Main article: Human genetics A graphical representation of the standard human karyotype, including both the female (XX) and male (XY) sex chromosomes. Like most animals, humans are a diploid and eukaryotic species. Each somatic cell has two sets of 23 chromosomes, each set received from one parent; gametes have only one set of chromosomes, which is a mixture of the two parental sets. Among the 23 pairs of chromosomes, there are 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. Like other mammals, humans have an XY sex-determination system, so that females have the sex chromosomes XX and males have XY.[172] Genes and environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility and mental abilities. The exact influence of genes and environment on certain traits is not well understood.[173][174] While no humans   not even monozygotic twins   are genetically identical,[175] two humans on average will have a genetic similarity of 99.5%-99.9%.[176][177] This makes them more homogeneous than other great apes, including chimpanzees.[178][179] This small variation in human DNA compared to many other species suggests a population bottleneck during the Late Pleistocene (around 100,000 years ago), in which the human population was reduced to a small number of breeding pairs.[180][181] The forces of natural selection have continued to operate on human populations, with evidence that certain regions of the genome display directional selection in the past 15,000 years.[182] The human genome was first sequenced in 2001[183] and by 2020 hundreds of thousands of genomes had been sequenced.[184] In 2012 the International HapMap Project had compared the genomes of 1,184 individuals from 11 populations and identified 1.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms.[185] African populations harbor the highest number of private genetic variants. While many of the common variants found in populations outside of Africa are also found on the African continent, there are still large numbers that are private to these regions, especially Oceania and the Americas.[186] By 2010 estimates, humans have approximately 22,000 genes.[187] By comparing mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited only from the mother, geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose genetic marker is found in all modern humans, the so-called mitochondrial Eve, must have lived around 90,000 to 200,000 years ago.[188][189][190][191] Life cycle See also: Childbirth and Life expectancy A 10 mm human embryo at 5 weeks Most human reproduction takes place by internal fertilization via sexual intercourse, but can also occur through assisted reproductive technology procedures.[192] The average gestation period is 38 weeks, but a normal pregnancy can vary by up to 37 days.[193] Embryonic development in the human covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a fetus.[194] Humans are able to induce early labor or perform a caesarean section if the child needs to be born earlier for medical reasons.[195] In developed countries, infants are typically 3 4 kg (7 9 lb) in weight and 47 53 cm (19 21 in) in height at birth.[196][197] However, low birth weight is common in developing countries, and contributes to the high levels of infant mortality in these regions.[198] Compared with other species, human childbirth is dangerous, with a much higher risk of complications and death.[199] The size of the fetus's head is more closely matched to the pelvis than in other primates.[200] The reason for this is not completely understood,[n 3] but it contributes to a painful labor that can last 24 hours or more.[202] The chances of a successful labor increased significantly during the 20th century in wealthier countries with the advent of new medical technologies. In contrast, pregnancy and natural childbirth remain hazardous ordeals in developing regions of the world, with maternal death rates approximately 100 times greater than in developed countries.[203] Both the mother and the father provide care for human offspring, in contrast to other primates, where parental care is mostly done by the mother.[204] Helpless at birth, humans continue to grow for some years, typically reaching sexual maturity at 15 to 17 years of age.[205][206][207] The human life span has been split into various stages ranging from three to twelve. Common stages include infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age.[208] The lengths of these stages have varied across cultures and time periods but is typified by an unusually rapid growth spurt during adolescence.[209] Human females undergo menopause and become infertile at around the age of 50.[210] It has been proposed that menopause increases a woman's overall reproductive success by allowing her to invest more time and resources in her existing offspring, and in turn their children (the grandmother hypothesis), rather than by continuing to bear children into old age.[211][212] The life span of an individual depends on two major factors, genetics and lifestyle choices.[213] For various reasons, including biological/genetic causes, women live on average about four years longer than men.[214] As of 2018[update], the global average life expectancy at birth of a girl is estimated to be 74.9 years compared to 70.4 for a boy.[215][216] There are significant geographical variations in human life expectancy, mostly correlated with economic development   for example, life expectancy at birth in Hong Kong is 87.6 years for girls and 81.8 for boys, while in the Central African Republic, it is 55.0 years for girls and 50.6 for boys.[217][218] The developed world is generally aging, with the median age around 40 years. In the developing world, the median age is between 15 and 20 years. While one in five Europeans is 60 years of age or older, only one in twenty Africans is 60 years of age or older.[219] In 2012, the United Nations estimated that there were 316,600 living centenarians (humans of age 100 or older) worldwide.[220] Human life stages Infant boy and girl Boy and girl before puberty (children) Adolescent male and female Adult man and woman Elderly man and woman Diet Main article: Human nutrition Humans living in Bali, Indonesia, preparing a mealHumans are omnivorous,[221] capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material.[222][223] Human groups have adopted a range of diets from purely vegan to primarily carnivorous. In some cases, dietary restrictions in humans can lead to deficiency diseases; however, stable human groups have adapted to many dietary patterns through both genetic specialization and cultural conventions to use nutritionally balanced food sources.[224] The human diet is prominently reflected in human culture and has led to the development of food science.[225] Until the development of agriculture, Homo sapiens employed a hunter-gatherer method as their sole means of food collection.[225] This involved combining stationary food sources (such as fruits, grains, tubers, and mushrooms, insect larvae and aquatic mollusks) with wild game, which must be hunted and captured in order to be consumed.[226] It has been proposed that humans have used fire to prepare and cook food since the time of Homo erectus.[227] Human domestication of wild plants began about 11,700 years ago, leading to the development of agriculture,[228] a gradual process called the Neolithic Revolution.[229] These dietary changes may also have altered human biology; the spread of dairy farming provided a new and rich source of food, leading to the evolution of the ability to digest lactose in some adults.[230][231] The types of food consumed, and how they are prepared, have varied widely by time, location, and culture.[232][233] In general, humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food, depending on stored body fat.[234] Survival without water is usually limited to three or four days, with a maximum of one week.[235] In 2020, it was estimated 9 million humans die every year from causes directly or indirectly related to starvation.[236][237] Childhood malnutrition is also common and contributes to the global burden of disease.[238] However, global food distribution is not even, and obesity among some human populations has increased rapidly, leading to health complications and increased mortality in some developed and a few developing countries. Worldwide, over one billion people are obese,[239] while in the United States 35% of people are obese, leading to this being described as an "obesity epidemic."[240] Obesity is caused by consuming more calories than are expended, so excessive weight gain is usually caused by an energy-dense diet.[239] Biological variation Main article: Human genetic variationA Libyan, a Nubian, a Syrian, and an Egyptian, drawing by an unknown artist after a mural of the tomb of Seti IThere is biological variation in the human species   with traits such as blood type, genetic diseases, cranial features, facial features, organ systems, eye color, hair color and texture, height and build, and skin color varying across the globe. The typical height of an adult human is between 1.4 and 1.9 m (4 ft 7 in and 6 ft 3 in), although this varies significantly depending on sex, ethnic origin, and family bloodlines.[241][242] Body size is partly determined by genes and is also significantly influenced by environmental factors such as diet, exercise, and sleep patterns.[243] A variety of human hair colors; from top left, clockwise: black, brown, blonde, white, red. There is evidence that populations have adapted genetically to various external factors. The genes that allow adult humans to digest lactose are present in high frequencies in populations that have long histories of cattle domestication and are more dependent on cow milk.[244] Sickle cell anemia, which may provide increased resistance to malaria, is frequent in populations where malaria is endemic.[245][246] Populations that have for a very long time inhabited specific climates tend to have developed specific phenotypes that are beneficial for those environments   short stature and stocky build in cold regions, tall and lanky in hot regions, and with high lung capacities or other adaptations at high altitudes.[247] Some populations have evolved highly unique adaptations to very specific environmental conditions, such as those advantageous to ocean-dwelling lifestyles and freediving in the Bajau.[248] Human hair ranges in color from red to blond to brown to black, which is the most frequent.[249] Hair color depends on the amount of melanin, with concentrations fading with increased age, leading to grey or even white hair. Skin color can range from darkest brown to lightest peach, or even nearly white or colorless in cases of albinism.[250] It tends to vary clinally and generally correlates with the level of ultraviolet radiation in a particular geographic area, with darker skin mostly around the equator.[251] Skin darkening may have evolved as protection against ultraviolet solar radiation.[252] Light skin pigmentation protects against depletion of vitamin D, which requires sunlight to make.[253] Human skin also has a capacity to darken (tan) in response to exposure to ultraviolet radiation.[254][255] There is relatively little variation between human geographical populations, and most of the variation that occurs is at the individual level.[250][256][257] Much of human variation is continuous, often with no clear points of demarcation.[258][259][260][261] Genetic data shows that no matter how population groups are defined, two people from the same population group are almost as different from each other as two people from any two different population groups.[262][263][264] Dark-skinned populations that are found in Africa, Australia, and South Asia are not closely related to each other.[265][266] Genetic research has demonstrated that human populations native to the African continent are the most genetically diverse[267] and genetic diversity decreases with migratory distance from Africa, possibly the result of bottlenecks during human migration.[268][269] These non-African populations acquired new genetic inputs from local admixture with archaic populations and have much greater variation from Neanderthals and Denisovans than is found in Africa,[186] though Neanderthal admixture into African populations may be underestimated.[270] Furthermore, recent studies have found that populations in sub-Saharan Africa, and particularly West Africa, have ancestral genetic variation which predates modern humans and has been lost in most non-African populations. Some of this ancestry is thought to originate from admixture with an unknown archaic hominin that diverged before the split of Neanderthals and modern humans.[271][272] Humans are a gonochoric species, meaning they are divided into male and female sexes.[273][274][275] The greatest degree of genetic variation exists between males and females. While the nucleotide genetic variation of individuals of the same sex across global populations is no greater than 0.1% 0.5%, the genetic difference between males and females is between 1% and 2%. Males on average are 15% heavier and 15 cm (6 in) taller than females.[276][277] On average, men have about 40 50% more upper-body strength and 20 30% more lower-body strength than women at the same weight, due to higher amounts of muscle and larger muscle fibers.[278] Women generally have a higher body fat percentage than men.[279] Women have lighter skin than men of the same population; this has been explained by a higher need for vitamin D in females during pregnancy and lactation.[280] As there are chromosomal differences between females and males, some X and Y chromosome-related conditions and disorders only affect either men or women.[281] After allowing for body weight and volume, the male voice is usually an octave deeper than the female voice.[282] Women have a longer life span in almost every population around the world.[283] There are intersex conditions in the human population, however these are rare.[284][285] Psychology Main article: PsychologyDrawing of the human brain, showing several important structures The human brain, the focal point of the central nervous system in humans, controls the peripheral nervous system. In addition to controlling "lower", involuntary, or primarily autonomic activities such as respiration and digestion, it is also the locus of "higher" order functioning such as thought, reasoning, and abstraction.[286] These cognitive processes constitute the mind, and, along with their behavioral consequences, are studied in the field of psychology. Humans have a larger and more developed prefrontal cortex than other primates, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition.[287][288] This has led humans to proclaim themselves to be more intelligent than any other known species.[289] Objectively defining intelligence is difficult, with other animals adapting senses and excelling in areas that humans are unable to.[290] There are some traits that, although not strictly unique, do set humans apart from other animals.[291] Humans may be the only animals who have episodic memory and who can engage in "mental time travel".[292] Even compared with other social animals, humans have an unusually high degree of flexibility in their facial expressions.[293] Humans are the only animals known to cry emotional tears.[294] Humans are one of the few animals able to self-recognize in mirror tests[295] and there is also debate over to what extent humans are the only animals with a theory of mind.[296][297] Sleep and dreaming Main articles: Sleep and Dream Humans are generally diurnal. The average sleep requirement is between seven and nine hours per day for an adult and nine to ten hours per day for a child; elderly people usually sleep for six to seven hours. Having less sleep than this is common among humans, even though sleep deprivation can have negative health effects. A sustained restriction of adult sleep to four hours per day has been shown to correlate with changes in physiology and mental state, including reduced memory, fatigue, aggression, and bodily discomfort.[298] During sleep humans dream, where they experience sensory images and sounds. Dreaming is stimulated by the pons and mostly occurs during the REM phase of sleep.[299] The length of a dream can vary, from a few seconds up to 30 minutes.[300] Humans have three to five dreams per night, and some may have up to seven.[301] Dreamers are more likely to remember the dream if awakened during the REM phase. The events in dreams are generally outside the control of the dreamer, with the exception of lucid dreaming, where the dreamer is self-aware.[302] Dreams can at times make a creative thought occur or give a sense of inspiration.[303] Consciousness and thought Main articles: Consciousness and Cognition Human consciousness, at its simplest, is sentience or awareness of internal or external existence.[304] Despite centuries of analyses, definitions, explanations and debates by philosophers and scientists, consciousness remains puzzling and controversial,[305] being "at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives".[306] The only widely agreed notion about the topic is the intuition that it exists.[307] Opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied and explained as consciousness. Some philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is sensory experience itself, and access consciousness, which can be used for reasoning or directly controlling actions.[308] It is sometimes synonymous with 'the mind', and at other times, an aspect of it. Historically it is associated with introspection, private thought, imagination and volition.[309] It now often includes some kind of experience, cognition, feeling or perception. It may be 'awareness', or 'awareness of awareness', or self-awareness.[310] There might be different levels or orders of consciousness,[311] or different kinds of consciousness, or just one kind with different features.[312] The process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses is known as cognition.[313] The human brain perceives the external world through the senses, and each individual human is influenced greatly by his or her experiences, leading to subjective views of existence and the passage of time.[314] The nature of thought is central to psychology and related fields. Cognitive psychology studies cognition, the mental processes underlying behavior.[315] Largely focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, developmental psychology seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age.[316][317] This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or moral development. Psychologists have developed intelligence tests and the concept of intelligence quotient in order to assess the relative intelligence of human beings and study its distribution among population.[318] Motivation and emotion Main articles: Motivation and Emotion Illustration of grief from Charles Darwin's 1872 book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals Human motivation is not yet wholly understood. From a psychological perspective, Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a well-established theory that can be defined as the process of satisfying certain needs in ascending order of complexity.[319] From a more general, philosophical perspective, human motivation can be defined as a commitment to, or withdrawal from, various goals requiring the application of human ability. Furthermore, incentive and preference are both factors, as are any perceived links between incentives and preferences. Volition may also be involved, in which case willpower is also a factor. Ideally, both motivation and volition ensure the selection, striving for, and realization of goals in an optimal manner, a function beginning in childhood and continuing throughout a lifetime in a process known as socialization.[320] Emotions are biological states associated with the nervous system[321][322] brought on by neurophysiological changes variously associated with thoughts, feelings, behavioral responses, and a degree of pleasure or displeasure.[323][324] They are often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, creativity,[325] and motivation. Emotion has a significant influence on human behavior and their ability to learn.[326] Acting on extreme or uncontrolled emotions can lead to social disorder and crime,[327] with studies showing criminals may have a lower emotional intelligence than normal.[328] Emotional experiences perceived as pleasant, such as joy, interest or contentment, contrast with those perceived as unpleasant, like anxiety, sadness, anger, and despair.[329] Happiness, or the state of being happy, is a human emotional condition. The definition of happiness is a common philosophical topic. Some define it as experiencing the feeling of positive emotional affects, while avoiding the negative ones.[330][331] Others see it as an appraisal of life satisfaction or quality of life.[332] Recent research suggests that being happy might involve experiencing some negative emotions when humans feel they are warranted.[333] Sexuality and love Main articles: Human sexuality and Love Human parents often display familial love for their children. For humans, sexuality involves biological, erotic, physical, emotional, social, or spiritual feelings and behaviors.[334][335] Because it is a broad term, which has varied with historical contexts over time, it lacks a precise definition.[335] The biological and physical aspects of sexuality largely concern the human reproductive functions, including the human sexual response cycle.[334][335] Sexuality also affects and is affected by cultural, political, legal, philosophical, moral, ethical, and religious aspects of life.[334][335] Sexual desire, or libido, is a basic mental state present at the beginning of sexual behavior. Studies show that men desire sex more than women and masturbate more often.[336] Humans can fall anywhere along a continuous scale of sexual orientation,[337] although most humans are heterosexual.[338][339] While homosexual behavior occurs in some other animals, only humans and domestic sheep have so far been found to exhibit exclusive preference for same-sex relationships.[338] Most evidence supports nonsocial, biological causes of sexual orientation,[338] as cultures that are very tolerant of homosexuality do not have significantly higher rates of it.[339][340] Research in neuroscience and genetics suggests that other aspects of human sexuality are biologically influenced as well.[341] Love most commonly refers to a feeling of strong attraction or emotional attachment. It can be impersonal (the love of an object, ideal, or strong political or spiritual connection) or interpersonal (love between humans).[342] When in love dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and other chemicals stimulate the brain's pleasure center, leading to side effects such as increased heart rate, loss of appetite and sleep, and an intense feeling of excitement.[343] Culture Main articles: Culture and Cultural universal Human society statisticsMost widely spoken languages[344][345]English, Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Standard Arabic, Bengali, French, Russian, Portuguese, UrduMost practiced religions[345][346]Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, folk religions, Sikhism, Judaism, unaffiliated Humanity's unprecedented set of intellectual skills were a key factor in the species' eventual technological advancement and concomitant domination of the biosphere.[347] Disregarding extinct hominids, humans are the only animals known to teach generalizable information,[348] innately deploy recursive embedding to generate and communicate complex concepts,[349] engage in the "folk physics" required for competent tool design,[350][351] or cook food in the wild.[352] Teaching and learning preserves the cultural and ethnographic identity of human societies.[353] Other traits and behaviors that are mostly unique to humans include starting fires,[354] phoneme structuring[355] and vocal learning.[356] Language Main article: Language Principal language families of the world (and in some cases geographic groups of families). For greater detail, see Distribution of languages in the world. While many species communicate, language is unique to humans, a defining feature of humanity, and a cultural universal.[357] Unlike the limited systems of other animals, human language is open   an infinite number of meanings can be produced by combining a limited number of symbols.[358][359] Human language also has the capacity of displacement, using words to represent things and happenings that are not presently or locally occurring but reside in the shared imagination of interlocutors.[152] Language differs from other forms of communication in that it is modality independent; the same meanings can be conveyed through different media, audibly in speech, visually by sign language or writing, and through tactile media such as braille.[360] Language is central to the communication between humans, and to the sense of identity that unites nations, cultures and ethnic groups.[361] There are approximately six thousand different languages currently in use, including sign languages, and many thousands more that are extinct.[362] The arts Main article: The artsHuman arts can take many forms including visual, literary, and performing. Visual art can range from paintings and sculptures to film, fashion design, and architecture.[363] Literary arts can include prose, poetry, and dramas. The performing arts generally involve theatre, music, and dance.[364][365] Humans often combine the different forms (for example, music videos).[366] Other entities that have been described as having artistic qualities include food preparation, video games, and medicine.[367][368][369] As well as providing entertainment and transferring knowledge, the arts are also used for political purposes.[370] The Deluge tablet of the Gilgamesh epic in Akkadian Art is a defining characteristic of humans and there is evidence for a relationship between creativity and language.[371] The earliest evidence of art was shell engravings made by Homo erectus 300,000 years before modern humans evolved.[372] Art attributed to H. sapiens existed at least 75,000 years ago, with jewellery and drawings found in caves in South Africa.[373][374] There are various hypotheses as to why humans have adapted to the arts. These include allowing them to better problem solve issues, providing a means to control or influence other humans, encouraging cooperation and contribution within a society or increasing the chance of attracting a potential mate.[375] The use of imagination developed through art, combined with logic may have given early humans an evolutionary advantage.[371] Evidence of humans engaging in musical activities predates cave art and so far music has been practiced by virtually all known human cultures.[376] There exists a wide variety of music genres and ethnic musics; with humans' musical abilities being related to other abilities, including complex social human behaviours.[376] It has been shown that human brains respond to music by becoming synchronized with the rhythm and beat, a process called entrainment.[377] Dance is also a form of human expression found in all cultures[378] and may have evolved as a way to help early humans communicate.[379] Listening to music and observing dance stimulates the orbitofrontal cortex and other pleasure sensing areas of the brain.[380] Unlike speaking, reading and writing does not come naturally to humans and must be taught.[381] Still, literature has been present before the invention of words and language, with 30,000-year-old paintings on walls inside some caves portraying a series of dramatic scenes.[382] One of the oldest surviving works of literature is the Epic of Gilgamesh, first engraved on ancient Babylonian tablets about 4,000 years ago.[383] Beyond simply passing down knowledge, the use and sharing of imaginative fiction through stories might have helped develop humans' capabilities for communication and increased the likelihood of securing a mate.[384] Storytelling may also be used as a way to provide the audience with moral lessons and encourage cooperation.[382] Tools and technologies Main articles: Tool and Technology The SCMaglev, the fastest train in the world clocking in at 603 km/h (375 mph) as of 2015[385] Stone tools were used by proto-humans at least 2.5 million years ago.[386] The use and manufacture of tools has been put forward as the ability that defines humans more than anything else[387] and has historically been seen as an important evolutionary step.[388] The technology became much more sophisticated about 1.8 million years ago,[387] with the controlled use of fire beginning around 1 million years ago.[389][390] The wheel and wheeled vehicles appeared simultaneously in several regions some time in the fourth millennium BC.[65] The development of more complex tools and technologies allowed land to be cultivated and animals to be domesticated, thus proving essential in the development of agriculture   what is known as the Neolithic Revolution.[391] China developed paper, the printing press, gunpowder, the compass and other important inventions.[392] The continued improvements in smelting allowed forging of copper, bronze, iron and eventually steel, which is used in railways, skyscrapers and many other products.[393] This coincided with the Industrial Revolution, where the invention of automated machines brought major changes to humans' lifestyles.[394] Modern technology is observed as progressing exponentially,[395] with major innovations in the 20th century including: electricity, penicillin, semiconductors, internal combustion engines, the Internet, nitrogen fixing fertilizers, airplanes, computers, automobiles, contraceptive pills, nuclear fission, the green revolution, radio, scientific plant breeding, rockets, air conditioning, television and the assembly line.[396] Religion and spirituality Main articles: Religion and Spirituality Shango, the Orisha of fire, lightning, and thunder, in the Yoruba religion, depicted on horseback Definitions of religion vary;[397] according to one definition, a religion is a belief system concerning the supernatural, sacred or divine, and practices, values, institutions and rituals associated with such belief. Some religions also have a moral code. The evolution and the history of the first religions have become areas of active scientific investigation.[398][399][400] Credible evidence of religious behaviour dates to the Middle Paleolithic era (45 200 thousand years ago).[401] It may have evolved to play a role in helping enforce and encourage cooperation between humans.[402] Religion manifests in diverse forms.[397] Religion can include a belief in life after death,[403] the origin of life, the nature of the universe (religious cosmology) and its ultimate fate (eschatology), and moral or ethical teachings.[404] Views on transcendence and immanence vary substantially; traditions variously espouse monism, deism, pantheism, and theism (including polytheism and monotheism).[405] Although measuring religiosity is difficult,[406] a majority of humans profess some variety of religious or spiritual belief.[407] In 2015 the plurality were Christian followed by Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists.[408] As of 2015, about 16%, or slightly under 1.2 billion humans, were irreligious, including those with no religious beliefs or no identity with any religion.[409] Science and philosophy Main articles: Science and Philosophy The Dunhuang map, a star map showing the North Polar region. China circa 700. An aspect unique to humans is their ability to transmit knowledge from one generation to the next and to continually build on this information to develop tools, scientific laws and other advances to pass on further.[410] This accumulated knowledge can be tested to answer questions or make predictions about how the universe functions and has been very successful in advancing human ascendancy.[411] Aristotle has been described as the first scientist,[412] and preceded the rise of scientific thought through the Hellenistic period.[413] Other early advances in science came from the Han dynasty in China and during the Islamic Golden Age.[414][91] The scientific revolution, near the end of the Renaissance, led to the emergence of modern science.[415] A chain of events and influences led to the development of the scientific method, a process of observation and experimentation that is used to differentiate science from pseudoscience.[416] An understanding of mathematics is unique to humans, although other species of animals have some numerical cognition.[417] All of science can be divided into three major branches, the formal sciences (e.g., logic and mathematics), which are concerned with formal systems, the applied sciences (e.g., engineering, medicine), which are focused on practical applications, and the empirical sciences, which are based on empirical observation and are in turn divided into natural sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology) and social sciences (e.g., psychology, economics, sociology).[418] Philosophy is a field of study where humans seek to understand fundamental truths about themselves and the world in which they live.[419] Philosophical inquiry has been a major feature in the development of humans' intellectual history.[420] It has been described as the "no man's land" between definitive scientific knowledge and dogmatic religious teachings.[421] Major fields of philosophy include metaphysics, epistemology, logic, and axiology (which includes ethics and aesthetics).[422] Society Main article: Society Humans often live in family-based social structures. Society is the system of organizations and institutions arising from interaction between humans. Humans are highly social and tend to live in large complex social groups. They can be divided into different groups according to their income, wealth, power, reputation and other factors. The structure of social stratification and the degree of social mobility differs, especially between modern and traditional societies.[423] Human groups range from the size of families to nations. The first form of human social organization is thought to have resembled hunter-gatherer band societies.[424] Gender Main article: Gender Depiction of a man and a woman from the Pioneer plaque Human societies typically exhibit gender identities and gender roles that distinguish between masculine and feminine characteristics and prescribe the range of acceptable behaviours and attitudes for their members based on their sex.[425][426] The most common categorisation is a gender binary of men and women.[427] Some societies recognize a third gender,[428] or less commonly a fourth or fifth.[429][430] In some other societies, non-binary is used as an umbrella term for a range of gender identities that are not solely male or female.[431] Gender roles are often associated with a division of norms, practices, dress, behavior, rights, duties, privileges, status, and power, with men enjoying more rights and privileges than women in most societies, both today and in the past.[432] As a social construct,[433] gender roles are not fixed and vary historically within a society. Challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.[434][435] Little is known about gender roles in the earliest human societies. Early modern humans probably had a range of gender roles similar to that of modern cultures from at least the Upper Paleolithic, while the Neanderthals were less sexually dimorphic and there is evidence that the behavioural difference between males and females was minimal.[436] Kinship Main article: Kinship All human societies organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations between parents, children and other descendants (consanguinity), and relations through marriage (affinity). There is also a third type applied to godparents or adoptive children (fictive). These culturally defined relationships are referred to as kinship. In many societies, it is one of the most important social organizing principles and plays a role in transmitting status and inheritance.[437] All societies have rules of incest taboo, according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations is prohibited, and some also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations.[438] Pair bonding is a ubiquitous feature of human sexual relationships, whether it is manifested as serial monogamy, polygyny, or polyandry.[439] Genetic evidence indicates that humans were predominantly polygynous for most of their existence as a species, but that this began to shift during the Neolithic, when monogamy started becoming widespread concomitantly with the transition from nomadic to sedentary societies.[440] Anatomical evidence in the form of second-to-fourth digit ratios, a biomarker for prenatal androgen effects, likewise indicates modern humans were polygynous during the Pleistocene.[441] Ethnicity Main article: Ethnic group Human ethnic groups are a social category that identifies together as a group based on shared attributes that distinguish them from other groups. These can be a common set of traditions, ancestry, language, history, society, culture, nation, religion, or social treatment within their residing area.[442][443] Ethnicity is separate from the concept of race, which is based on physical characteristics, although both are socially constructed.[444] Assigning ethnicity to a certain population is complicated, as even within common ethnic designations there can be a diverse range of subgroups, and the makeup of these ethnic groups can change over time at both the collective and individual level.[178] Also, there is no generally accepted definition of what constitutes an ethnic group.[445] Ethnic groupings can play a powerful role in the social identity and solidarity of ethnopolitical units. This has been closely tied to the rise of the nation state as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th centuries.[446][447][448] Government and politics Main articles: Government and Politics The United Nations headquarters (left) in New York City, which houses one of the world's largest political organizations As farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities, interactions between these different groups increased. This led to the development of governance within and between the communities.[449] Humans have evolved the ability to change affiliation with various social groups relatively easily, including previously strong political alliances, if doing so is seen as providing personal advantages.[450] This cognitive flexibility allows individual humans to change their political ideologies, with those with higher flexibility less likely to support authoritarian and nationalistic stances.[451] Governments create laws and policies that affect the citizens that they govern. There have been many forms of government throughout human history, each having various means of obtaining power and the ability to exert diverse controls on the population.[452] Approximately 47% of humans live in some form of a democracy, 17% in a hybrid regime, and 37% in an authoritarian regime.[453] Many countries belong to international organizations and alliances; the largest of these is the United Nations, with 193 member states.[454] Trade and economics Main articles: Trade and Economics The Silk Road (red) and spice trade routes (blue) Trade, the voluntary exchange of goods and services, is seen as a characteristic that differentiates humans from other animals and has been cited as a practice that gave Homo sapiens a major advantage over other hominids.[455] Evidence suggests early H. sapiens made use of long-distance trade routes to exchange goods and ideas, leading to cultural explosions and providing additional food sources when hunting was sparse, while such trade networks did not exist for the now extinct Neanderthals.[456][457] Early trade likely involved materials for creating tools like obsidian.[458] The first truly international trade routes were around the spice trade through the Roman and medieval periods.[459] Early human economies were more likely to be based around gift giving instead of a bartering system.[460] Early money consisted of commodities; the oldest being in the form of cattle and the most widely used being cowrie shells.[461] Money has since evolved into governmental issued coins, paper and electronic money.[461] Human study of economics is a social science that looks at how societies distribute scarce resources among different people.[462] There are massive inequalities in the division of wealth among humans; the eight richest humans are worth the same monetary value as the poorest half of all the human population.[463] Conflict Main article: Conflict (process) American troops landing at Normandy, WWII Humans commit violence on other humans at a rate comparable to other primates, but have an increased preference for killing adults, infanticide being more common among other primates.[464] Phylogenetic analysis predicts that 2% of early H. sapiens would be murdered, rising to 12% during the medieval period, before dropping to below 2% in modern times.[465] There is great variation in violence between human populations, with rates of homicide about 0.01% in societies that have legal systems and strong cultural attitudes against violence.[466] The willingness of humans to kill other members of their species en masse through organized conflict (i.e., war) has long been the subject of debate. One school of thought holds that war evolved as a means to eliminate competitors, and has always been an innate human characteristic. Another suggests that war is a relatively recent phenomenon and has appeared due to changing social conditions.[467] While not settled, current evidence indicates warlike predispositions only became common about 10,000 years ago, and in many places much more recently than that.[467] War has had a high cost on human life; it is estimated that during the 20th century, between 167 million and 188 million people died as a result of war.[468] War casualty data is less reliable for pre-medieval times, especially global figures. But compared with any period over the past 600 years, the last ~80 years (post 1946), has seen a very significant drop in global military and civilian death rates due to armed conflict.[469] See also Mammals portalEvolutionary biology portalScience portal List of human evolution fossils Timeline of human evolution Notes ^ The world population and population density statistics are updated automatically from a template that uses the CIA World Factbook and United Nations World Population Prospects.[124][125] ^ Cities with over 10 million inhabitants as of 2018.[126] ^ Traditionally this has been explained by conflicting evolutionary pressures involved in bipedalism and encephalization (called the obstetrical dilemma), but recent research suggest it might be more complicated than that.[200][201] References ^ Roopnarine PD (March 2014).

I would suggest that when we talk about happiness, we are actually referring, much of the time, to a complex emotional phenomenon. Call it emotional well-being. Happiness as emotional well-being concerns your emotions and moods, more broadly your emotional condition as a whole. To be happy is to inhabit a favorable emotional state.... On this view, we can think of happiness, loosely, as the opposite of anxiety and depression. Being in good spirits, quick to laugh and slow to anger, at peace and untroubled, confident and comfortable in your own skin, engaged, energetic and full of life. ^ Graham MC (2014).

In essence, an ethnic group is a named social category of people based on perceptions of shared social experience or one's ancestors' experiences. Members of the ethnic group see themselves as sharing cultural traditions and history that distinguish them from other groups. Ethnic group identity has a strong psychological or emotional component that divides the people of the world into opposing categories of 'us' and 'them.' In contrast to social stratification, which divides and unifies people along a series of horizontal axes based on socioeconomic factors, ethnic identities divide and unify people along a series of vertical axes. Thus, ethnic groups, at least theoretically, cut across socioeconomic class differences, drawing members from all strata of the population. ^ Blackmore E (22 February 2019).

Using their intelligence, humans are able to learn, form concepts, understand, and apply logic and reason. Human intelligence is also thought to encompass their capacities to recognize patterns, plan, innovate, solve problems, make decisions, retain information, and use language to communicate. There are conflicting ideas about how intelligence should be conceptualized and measured. In psychometrics, human intelligence is commonly assessed by intelligence quotient (IQ) tests, although the validity of these tests is disputed. Several subcategories of intelligence, such as emotional intelligence and social intelligence, have been proposed, and there remains significant debate as to whether these represent distinct forms of intelligence.[1] There is also ongoing debate regarding how an individual's level of intelligence is formed, ranging from the idea that intelligence is fixed at birth to the idea that it is malleable and can change depending on a person's mindset and efforts.[2] History[edit] Main article: Evolution of human intelligence See also: Evolution of the brain This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (February 2022) Correlates[edit] As a construct and as measured by intelligence tests, intelligence is one of the most useful concepts in psychology, because it correlates with many relevant variables, for instance the probability of suffering an accident, or the amount of one's salary.[3] Other examples include: Education Further information: Intelligence and education According to a 2018 metastudy of educational effects on intelligence, education appears to be the "most consistent, robust, and durable method" known for raising intelligence.[4] Personality A landmark set of meta-analyses synthesizing thousands of studies including millions of people from over 50 countries found that many personality traits are intricately related to cognitive abilities. Neuroticism-related traits display the most negative relations, whereas traits like activity, industriousness, compassion, and openness are positively related to various abilities.[5] Myopia A number of studies have shown a correlation between IQ and myopia.[6] Some suggest that the reason for the correlation is environmental: either people with a higher IQ are more likely to damage their eyesight with prolonged reading, or people who read more are more likely to attain a higher IQ; others contend that a genetic link exists.[7] Aging There is evidence that aging causes a decline in cognitive functions. In one cross-sectional study, various cognitive functions measured declines by about 0.8 in z-score from age 20 to age 50; the cognitive functions included speed of processing, working memory, and long-term memory.[8] Genes A number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in human DNA are correlated with higher IQ scores.[9] Motivation Motivation is a factor that influences the results of the IQ test. People with higher motivation tend to obtain higher IQ scores.[10] Theories[edit] Relevance of IQ tests[edit] Further information:   Insufficiency of measurement via IQ In psychology, human intelligence is commonly assessed by IQ scores that are determined by IQ tests. In general, higher IQ scores are associated with better outcomes in life.[11] However, while IQ test scores show a high degree of inter-test reliability, and predict certain forms of achievement effectively, their construct validity as a holistic measure of human intelligence is considered dubious.[12][13] While IQ tests are generally understood to measure some forms of intelligence, they may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of human intelligence inclusive of creativity and social intelligence.[13] According to psychologist Wayne Weiten, "IQ tests are valid measures of the kind of intelligence necessary to do well in academic work. But if the purpose is to assess intelligence in a broader sense, the validity of IQ tests is questionable."[13] Theory of multiple intelligences[edit] Main article: Theory of multiple intelligences Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences is based on studies of normal children and adults, of gifted individuals (including so-called "savants"), of persons who have suffered brain damage, of experts and virtuosos, and of individuals from diverse cultures. Gardner breaks intelligence down into components. In the first edition of his book Frames of Mind (1983), he described seven distinct types of intelligence: logical-mathematical, linguistic, spatial, musical, kinesthetic, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. In a second edition, he added two more types of intelligence: naturalist and existential intelligences. He argues that psychometric (IQ) tests address only linguistic and logical plus some aspects of spatial intelligence.[14] A criticism of Gardner's theory is that it has never been tested, or subjected to peer review, by Gardner or anyone else, and indeed that it is unfalsifiable.[15] Others (e.g. Locke, 2005[16]) suggest that recognizing many specific forms of intelligence (specific aptitude theory) implies a political rather than scientific agenda, intended to appreciate the uniqueness in all individuals, rather than recognizing potentially true and meaningful differences in individual capacities. Schmidt and Hunter[17] suggest that the predictive validity of specific aptitudes over and above that of general mental ability, or "g", has not received empirical support. On the other hand, Jerome Bruner agreed with Gardner that the intelligences were "useful fictions", and went on to state that "his approach is so far beyond the data-crunching of mental testers that it deserves to be cheered."[18] Triarchic theory of intelligence[edit] Main article: Triarchic theory of intelligence Robert Sternberg proposed the triarchic theory of intelligence to provide a more comprehensive description of intellectual competence than traditional differential or cognitive theories of human ability.[19] The triarchic theory describes three fundamental aspects of intelligence: Analytic intelligence comprises the mental processes through which intelligence is expressed. Creative intelligence is necessary when an individual is confronted with a challenge that is nearly, but not entirely, novel or when an individual is engaged in automatizing the performance of a task. Practical intelligence is bound to a sociocultural milieu and involves adaptation to, selection of, and shaping of the environment to maximize fit in the context. The triarchic theory does not argue against the validity of a general intelligence factor; instead, the theory posits that general intelligence is part of analytic intelligence, and only by considering all three aspects of intelligence can the full range of intellectual functioning be understood. Sternberg updated the triarchic theory and renamed it to the Theory of Successful Intelligence.[20] He now defines intelligence as an individual's assessment of success in life by the individual's own (idiographic) standards and within the individual's sociocultural context. Success is achieved by using combinations of analytical, creative, and practical intelligence. The three aspects of intelligence are referred to as processing skills. The processing skills are applied to the pursuit of success through what were the three elements of practical intelligence: adapting to, shaping of, and selecting of one's environments. The mechanisms that employ the processing skills to achieve success include utilizing one's strengths and compensating or correcting for one's weaknesses. Sternberg's theories and research on intelligence remain contentious within the scientific community.[21] PASS theory of intelligence[edit] Main article: PASS Theory of Intelligence Based on A. R. Luria's (1966) seminal work on the modularization of brain function,[22] and supported by decades of neuroimaging research, the PASS Theory of Intelligence (Planning/Attention/Simultaneous/Successive) proposes that cognition is organized in three systems and the following four processes:[23] Planning involves executive functions responsible for controlling and organizing behavior, selecting and constructing strategies, and monitoring performance. Attention is responsible for maintaining arousal levels and alertness, and ensuring focus on relevant stimuli. Simultaneous processing is engaged when the relationship between items and their integration into whole units of information is required. Examples of this include recognizing figures, such as a triangle within a circle vs. a circle within a triangle, or the difference between "he had a shower before breakfast" and "he had breakfast before a shower." Successive processing is required for organizing separate items in a sequence such as remembering a sequence of words or actions exactly in the order in which they had just been presented. These four processes are functions of four areas of the brain. Planning is broadly located in the front part of our brains, the frontal lobe. Attention and arousal are combined functions of the frontal lobe and the lower parts of the cortex, although the parietal lobes are also involved in attention as well. Simultaneous processing and Successive processing occur in the posterior region or the back of the brain. Simultaneous processing is broadly associated with the occipital and the parietal lobes while Successive processing is broadly associated with the frontal-temporal lobes. The PASS theory is heavily indebted both to Luria[22][24] and to studies in cognitive psychology involved in promoting a better look at intelligence.[25] Piaget's theory and Neo-Piagetian theories[edit] Main articles: Piaget's theory of cognitive development and Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development In Piaget's theory of cognitive development the focus is not on mental abilities but rather on a child's mental models of the world. As a child develops, the child creates increasingly more accurate models of the world which enable the child to interact with the world more effectively. One example is object permanence with which the child develops a model in which objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen, heard, or touched. Piaget's theory described four main stages and many sub-stages in the development. These four main stages are: sensorimotor stage (birth 2 years) pre-operational stage (2 7 years) concrete operational stage (7 11 years) formal operations stage (11 16 years)[26] Progress through these stages is correlated with, but not identical to psychometric IQ.[27] Piaget conceptualizes intelligence as an activity more than as a capacity. One of Piaget's most famous studies focused purely on the discriminative abilities of children between the ages of two and a half years old, and four and a half years old. He began the study by taking children of different ages and placing two lines of sweets, one with the sweets in a line spread further apart, and one with the same number of sweets in a line placed more closely together. He found that, "Children between 2 years, 6 months old and 3 years, 2 months old correctly discriminate the relative number of objects in two rows; between 3 years, 2 months and 4 years, 6 months they indicate a longer row with fewer objects to have 'more'; after 4 years, 6 months they again discriminate correctly".[28] Initially younger children were not studied, because if at the age of four years a child could not conserve quantity, then a younger child presumably could not either. The results show however that children that are younger than three years and two months have quantity conservation, but as they get older they lose this quality, and do not recover it until four and a half years old. This attribute may be lost temporarily because of an overdependence on perceptual strategies, which correlates more candy with a longer line of candy, or because of the inability for a four-year-old to reverse situations.[26] This experiment demonstrated several results. First, younger children have a discriminative ability that shows the logical capacity for cognitive operations exists earlier than previously acknowledged. Also, young children can be equipped with certain qualities for cognitive operations, depending on how logical the structure of the task is. Research also shows that children develop explicit understanding at age five and as a result, the child will count the sweets to decide which has more. Finally the study found that overall quantity conservation is not a basic characteristic of humans' native inheritance.[26] Piaget's theory has been criticized on the grounds that the age of appearance of a new model of the world, such as object permanence, is dependent on how the testing is done (see the article on object permanence). More generally, the theory may be very difficult to test empirically because of the difficulty of proving or disproving that a mental model is the explanation for the results of the testing.[29] Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development expand Piaget's theory in various ways such as also considering psychometric-like factors such as processing speed and working memory, "hypercognitive" factors like self-monitoring, more stages, and more consideration on how progress may vary in different domains such as spatial or social.[30] Parieto-frontal integration theory of intelligence[edit] Main article: Parieto-frontal integration theory Based on a review of 37 neuroimaging studies, Jung and Haier proposed that the biological basis of intelligence stems from how well the frontal and parietal regions of the brain communicate and exchange information with each other.[31] Subsequent neuroimaging and lesion studies report general consensus with the theory.[32] A review of the neuroscience and intelligence literature concludes that the parieto-frontal integration theory is the best available explanation for human intelligence differences.[33] Investment theory[edit] Based on the Cattell Horn Carroll theory, the tests of intelligence most often used in the relevant[clarification needed] studies include measures of fluid ability (gf) and crystallized ability (gc); that differ in their trajectory of development in people.[34] The "investment theory" by Cattell[35] states that the individual differences observed in the procurement of skills and knowledge (gc) are partially attributed to the "investment" of gf, thus suggesting the involvement of fluid intelligence in every aspect of the learning process.[36] The investment theory suggests that personality traits affect "actual" ability, and not scores on an IQ test.[37] Hebb's theory of intelligence suggested a bifurcation as well, Intelligence A (physiological), that could be seen as a semblance of fluid intelligence and Intelligence B (experiential), similar to crystallized intelligence.[38] Intelligence compensation theory (ICT)[edit] The intelligence compensation theory[39] states that individuals who are comparatively less intelligent work harder and more methodically, and become more resolute and thorough (more conscientious) in order to achieve goals, to compensate for their "lack of intelligence" whereas more intelligent individuals do not require traits/behaviours associated with the personality factor conscientiousness to progress as they can rely on the strength of their cognitive abilities as opposed to structure or effort.[40] The theory suggests the existence of a causal relationship between intelligence and conscientiousness, such that the development of the personality trait of conscientiousness is influenced by intelligence. This assumption is deemed plausible as it is unlikely that the reverse causal relationship could occur;[41] implying that the negative correlation would be higher between fluid intelligence (gf) and conscientiousness. This is justified by the timeline of development of gf, gc, and personality, as crystallized intelligence would not have developed completely when personality traits develop. Subsequently, during school-going ages, more conscientious children would be expected to gain more crystallized intelligence (knowledge) through education, as they would be more efficient, thorough, hard-working, and dutiful.[42] This theory has recently been contradicted by evidence that identifies compensatory sample selection which attributes the findings to the bias that comes from selecting samples containing people above a certain threshold of achievement.[43] Bandura's theory of self-efficacy and cognition[edit] The view of cognitive ability has evolved over the years, and it is no longer viewed as a fixed property held by an individual. Instead, the current perspective describes it as a general capacity[clarification needed], comprising not only cognitive, but motivational, social, and behavioural aspects as well. These facets work together to perform numerous tasks. An essential skill often overlooked is that of managing emotions and aversive experiences that can compromise one's quality of thought and activity. Bandura bridges the link between intelligence and success by crediting individual differences in self-efficacy. Bandura's theory identifies the difference between possessing skills and being able to apply them in challenging situations. The theory suggests that individuals with the same level of knowledge and skill may perform badly, averagely, or excellently based on differences in self-efficacy. A key role of cognition is to allow for one to predict events and in turn devise methods to deal with these events effectively. These skills are dependent on processing of unclear and ambiguous stimuli. People must be able to rely on their reserve of knowledge to identify, develop, and execute options. They must be able to apply the learning acquired from previous experiences. Thus, a stable sense of self-efficacy is essential to stay focused on tasks in the face of challenging situations.[44] Bandura's theory of self-efficacy and intelligence suggests that individuals with a relatively low sense of self-efficacy in any field will avoid challenges. This effect is heightened when they perceive the situations as personal threats. When failure occurs, they recover from it more slowly than others, and credit the failure to an insufficient aptitude. On the other hand, persons with high levels of self-efficacy hold a task-diagnostic aim[clarification needed] that leads to effective performance.[45] Process, personality, intelligence and knowledge theory (PPIK)[edit] This section needs expansion with: more extensive and clear explanations. You can help by adding to it. (March 2018) Predicted growth curves for Intelligence as process, crystallized intelligence, occupational knowledge, and avocational knowledge based on Ackerman's PPIK Theory[citation needed] Developed by Ackerman, the PPIK (process, personality, intelligence, and knowledge) theory further develops the approach on intelligence as proposed by Cattell, the Investment theory, and Hebb, suggesting a distinction between intelligence as knowledge and intelligence as process (two concepts that are comparable and related to gc and gf respectively, but broader and closer to Hebb's notions of "Intelligence A" and "Intelligence B") and integrating these factors with elements such as personality, motivation, and interests.[46][47] Ackerman describes the difficulty of distinguishing process from knowledge, as content cannot be eliminated from any ability test.[46][47][48] Personality traits are not significantly correlated with the intelligence as process aspect except in the context of psychopathology. One exception to this generalization has been the finding of sex differences in cognitive abilities, specifically abilities in mathematical and spatial form.[46][49] On the other hand, the intelligence as knowledge factor has been associated with personality traits of Openness and Typical Intellectual Engagement,[46][50] which also strongly correlate with verbal abilities (associated with crystallized intelligence).[46] Latent inhibition[edit] Main article: Latent inhibition It appears that Latent inhibition, the phenomenon of familiar stimuli having a postponed reaction time when compared with unfamiliar stimuli, has a positive correlation with creativity.[citation needed] Improving[edit] Further information: Neuroenhancement and Intelligence amplification Genetic engineering[edit] See also: Human genetic enhancement and Neurogenetics Because intelligence appears to be at least partly dependent on brain structure and the genes shaping brain development, it has been proposed that genetic engineering could be used to enhance intelligence, a process sometimes called biological uplift in science fiction. Genetic enhancement experiments on mice have demonstrated superior ability in learning and memory in various behavioral tasks.[51] Education[edit] Higher IQ leads to greater success in education,[52] but independently, education raises IQ scores.[53] A 2017 meta-analysis suggests education increases IQ by 1 5 points per year of education, or at least increases IQ test-taking ability.[54] Nutrition and chemicals[edit] See also: Healthy diet, Nutrition and cognition, Dietary supplement, Nutraceutical, and Eugeroic Substances which actually or purportedly improve intelligence or other mental functions are called nootropics. A meta analysis shows omega-3 fatty acids improve cognitive performance among those with cognitive deficits, but not among healthy subjects.[55] A meta-regression shows omega-3 fatty acids improve the moods of patients with major depression (major depression is associated with cognitive nutrient deficits).[56] Activities and adult neural development[edit] See also: Development of the nervous system in humans   Adult neural development This section is in list format but may read better as prose.

Some educators and experts have raised some concerns about how technology may negatively affect students  thinking abilities and academic performance.[61] Measured results of the study Brain training[edit] Attempts to raise IQ with brain training have led to increases on aspects related with the training tasks   for instance working memory   but it is yet unclear if these increases generalize to increased intelligence per se.[62] A 2008 research paper claimed that practicing a dual n-back task can increase fluid intelligence (gf), as measured in several different standard tests.[63] This finding received some attention from popular media, including an article in Wired.[64] However, a subsequent criticism of the paper's methodology questioned the experiment's validity and took issue with the lack of uniformity in the tests used to evaluate the control and test groups.[65] For example, the progressive nature of Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) test may have been compromised by modifications of time restrictions (i.e., 10 minutes were allowed to complete a normally 45-minute test). Philosophy[edit] Efforts to influence intelligence raise ethical issues. Neuroethics considers the ethical, legal, and social implications of neuroscience, and deals with issues such as the difference between treating a human neurological disease and enhancing the human brain, and how wealth impacts access to neurotechnology. Neuroethical issues interact with the ethics of human genetic engineering. Transhumanist theorists study the possibilities and consequences of developing and using techniques to enhance human abilities and aptitudes. Eugenics is a social philosophy that advocates the improvement of human hereditary traits through various forms of intervention.[66] Eugenics has variously been regarded as meritorious or deplorable in different periods of history, falling greatly into disrepute after the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.[67] Measuring[edit] Main article: Intelligence quotient Further information: Psychometrics Score distribution chart for sample of 905 children tested on 1916 Stanford-Binet Test The approach to understanding intelligence with the most supporters and published research over the longest period of time is based on psychometric testing. It is also by far the most widely used in practical settings.[14] Intelligence quotient (IQ) tests include the Stanford-Binet, Raven's Progressive Matrices, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children. There are also psychometric tests that are not intended to measure intelligence itself but some closely related construct such as scholastic aptitude. In the United States examples include the SSAT, the SAT, the ACT, the GRE, the MCAT, the LSAT, and the GMAT.[14] Regardless of the method used, almost any test that requires examinees to reason and has a wide range of question difficulty will produce intelligence scores that are approximately normally distributed in the general population.[68][69] Intelligence tests are widely used in educational,[70] business, and military settings because of their efficacy in predicting behavior. IQ and g (discussed in the next section) are correlated with many important social outcomes individuals with low IQs are more likely to be divorced, have a child out of marriage, be incarcerated, and need long-term welfare support, while individuals with high IQs are associated with more years of education, higher status jobs and higher income.[71] Intelligence as measured by Psychometric tests has been found to be highly correlated with successful training and performance outcomes (e.g., adaptive performance),[72][73][74] and IQ/g is the single best predictor of successful job performance; however, some researchers although largely concurring with this finding have advised caution in citing the strength of the claim due to a number of factors, these include: statistical assumptions imposed underlying some of these studies, studies done prior to 1970 which appear inconsistent with more recent studies, and ongoing debates within the Psychology literature as to the validity of current IQ measurement tools.[75][76] General intelligence factor or g[edit] Main article: g factor (psychometrics) There are many different kinds of IQ tests using a wide variety of test tasks. Some tests consist of a single type of task, others rely on a broad collection of tasks with different contents (visual-spatial,[77] verbal, numerical) and asking for different cognitive processes (e.g., reasoning, memory, rapid decisions, visual comparisons, spatial imagery, reading, and retrieval of general knowledge). The psychologist Charles Spearman early in the 20th century carried out the first formal factor analysis of correlations between various test tasks. He found a trend for all such tests to correlate positively with each other, which is called a positive manifold. Spearman found that a single common factor explained the positive correlations among tests. Spearman named it g for "general intelligence factor". He interpreted it as the core of human intelligence that, to a larger or smaller degree, influences success in all cognitive tasks and thereby creates the positive manifold. This interpretation of g as a common cause of test performance is still dominant in psychometrics. (Although, an alternative interpretation was recently advanced by van der Maas and colleagues.[78] Their mutualism model assumes that intelligence depends on several independent mechanisms, none of which influences performance on all cognitive tests. These mechanisms support each other so that efficient operation of one of them makes efficient operation of the others more likely, thereby creating the positive manifold.) IQ tests can be ranked by how highly they load on the g factor. Tests with high g-loadings are those that correlate highly with most other tests. One comprehensive study investigating the correlations between a large collection of tests and tasks[79] has found that the Raven's Progressive Matrices have a particularly high correlation with most other tests and tasks. The Raven's is a test of inductive reasoning with abstract visual material. It consists of a series of problems, sorted approximately by increasing difficulty. Each problem presents a 3 x 3 matrix of abstract designs with one empty cell; the matrix is constructed according to a rule, and the person must find out the rule to determine which of 8 alternatives fits into the empty cell. Because of its high correlation with other tests, the Raven's Progressive Matrices are generally acknowledged as a good indicator of general intelligence. This is problematic, however, because there are substantial gender differences on the Raven's,[80] which are not found when g is measured directly by computing the general factor from a broad collection of tests.[81] Several critics, such as Stephen Jay Gould, have been critical of g, seeing it as a statistical artifact, and that IQ tests instead measure a number of unrelated abilities.[82][83] The 1995 American Psychological Association's report "Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns" stated that IQ tests do correlate and that the view that g is a statistical artifact was a minority one. General collective intelligence factor or c[edit] Main article: Collective intelligence A recent scientific understanding of collective intelligence, defined as a group's general ability to perform a wide range of tasks,[84] expands the areas of human intelligence research applying similar methods and concepts to groups. Definition, operationalization and methods are similar to the psychometric approach of general individual intelligence where an individual's performance on a given set of cognitive tasks is used to measure intelligence indicated by the general intelligence factor g extracted via factor analysis.[85] In the same vein, collective intelligence research aims to discover a c factor' explaining between-group differences in performance as well as structural and group compositional causes for it.[86] Historical psychometric theories[edit] Main article: Intelligence quotient   History Several different theories of intelligence have historically been important for psychometrics. Often they emphasized more factors than a single one like in g factor. Cattell Horn Carroll theory[edit] Main article: Cattell Horn Carroll theory Many of the broad, recent IQ tests have been greatly influenced by the Cattell Horn Carroll theory. It is argued to reflect much of what is known about intelligence from research. A hierarchy of factors for human intelligence is used. g is at the top. Under it there are 10 broad abilities that in turn are subdivided into 70 narrow abilities. The broad abilities are:[87] Fluid intelligence (Gf): includes the broad ability to reason, form concepts, and solve problems using unfamiliar information or novel procedures. Crystallized intelligence (Gc): includes the breadth and depth of a person's acquired knowledge, the ability to communicate one's knowledge, and the ability to reason using previously learned experiences or procedures. Quantitative reasoning (Gq): the ability to comprehend quantitative concepts and relationships and to manipulate numerical symbols. Reading & writing ability (Grw): includes basic reading and writing skills. Short-term memory (Gsm): is the ability to apprehend and hold information in immediate awareness and then use it within a few seconds. Long-term storage and retrieval (Glr): is the ability to store information and fluently retrieve it later in the process of thinking. Visual processing (Gv): is the ability to perceive, analyze, synthesize, and think with visual patterns, including the ability to store and recall visual representations. Auditory processing (Ga): is the ability to analyze, synthesize, and discriminate auditory stimuli, including the ability to process and discriminate speech sounds that may be presented under distorted conditions. Processing speed (Gs): is the ability to perform automatic cognitive tasks, particularly when measured under pressure to maintain focused attention. Decision/reaction time/speed (Gt): reflect the immediacy with which an individual can react to stimuli or a task (typically measured in seconds or fractions of seconds; not to be confused with Gs, which typically is measured in intervals of 2 3 minutes). See Mental chronometry. Modern tests do not necessarily measure of all of these broad abilities. For example, Gq and Grw may be seen as measures of school achievement and not IQ.[87] Gt may be difficult to measure without special equipment. g was earlier often subdivided into only Gf and Gc which were thought to correspond to the nonverbal or performance subtests and verbal subtests in earlier versions of the popular Wechsler IQ test. More recent research has shown the situation to be more complex.[87] Insufficiency of measurement via IQ[edit] This section is an excerpt from Intelligence quotient   Validity as a measure of intelligence.[edit] Reliability and validity are very different concepts. While reliability reflects reproducibility, validity refers to whether the test measures what it purports to measure.[88] While IQ tests are generally considered to measure some forms of intelligence, they may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of human intelligence inclusive of, for example, creativity and social intelligence. For this reason, psychologist Wayne Weiten argues that their construct validity must be carefully qualified, and not be overstated.[88] According to Weiten, "IQ tests are valid measures of the kind of intelligence necessary to do well in academic work. But if the purpose is to assess intelligence in a broader sense, the validity of IQ tests is questionable."[88] Some scientists have disputed the value of IQ as a measure of intelligence altogether. In The Mismeasure of Man (1981, expanded edition 1996), evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould compared IQ testing with the now-discredited practice of determining intelligence via craniometry, arguing that both are based on the fallacy of reification, "our tendency to convert abstract concepts into entities".[89] Gould's argument sparked a great deal of debate,[90][91] and the book is listed as one of Discover Magazine's "25 Greatest Science Books of All Time".[92] Along these same lines, critics such as Keith Stanovich do not dispute the capacity of IQ test scores to predict some kinds of achievement, but argue that basing a concept of intelligence on IQ test scores alone neglects other important aspects of mental ability.[93][94] Robert Sternberg, another significant critic of IQ as the main measure of human cognitive abilities, argued that reducing the concept of intelligence to the measure of g does not fully account for the different skills and knowledge types that produce success in human society.[95] Despite these objections, clinical psychologists generally regard IQ scores as having sufficient statistical validity for many clinical purposes.[specify][96][97] A study suggested that intelligence is composed of distinct cognitive systems, each of which having its own capacity and being (to some degree) independent of other components, with the cognitive profile being emergent from anatomically distinct cognitive systems (such as brain regions or neural networks).[98][99] For example, IQ and reading-/language-related traits/skills appear to be influenced "at least partly [by] distinct genetic factors".[100][101] Various types of potential measures related to some definitions of intelligence but not part of IQ measurement include: Cognitive flexibility   abilities in switching between different concepts, or to adapt behaviour in novel or changing environments[102] Moral intelligence[103][104] Prioritization and goal-selection Direct measures of brain activity[103] and other neuroimaging intelligence testing   partly investigated in the neuroscience of intelligence Intelligence across cultures[edit] Psychologists have shown that the definition of human intelligence is unique to the culture that one is studying. Robert Sternberg is among the researchers who have discussed how one's culture affects the person's interpretation of intelligence, and he further believes that to define intelligence in only one way without considering different meanings in cultural contexts may cast an investigative and unintentionally egocentric view on the world. To negate this, psychologists offer the following definitions of intelligence: Successful intelligence is the skills and knowledge needed for success in life, according to one's own definition of success, within one's sociocultural context. Analytical intelligence is the result of intelligence's components applied to fairly abstract but familiar kinds of problems. Creative intelligence is the result of intelligence's components applied to relatively novel tasks and situations. Practical intelligence is the result of intelligence's components applied to experience for purposes of adaption, shaping and selection.[105] Although typically identified by its western definition, multiple studies support the idea that human intelligence carries different meanings across cultures around the world. In many Eastern cultures, intelligence is mainly related with one's social roles and responsibilities. A Chinese conception of intelligence would define it as the ability to empathize with and understand others   although this is by no means the only way that intelligence is defined in China. In several African communities, intelligence is shown similarly through a social lens. However, rather than through social roles, as in many Eastern cultures, it is exemplified through social responsibilities. For example, in the language of Chi-Chewa, which is spoken by some ten million people across central Africa, the equivalent term for intelligence implies not only cleverness but also the ability to take on responsibility. Furthermore, within American culture there are a variety of interpretations of intelligence present as well. One of the most common views on intelligence within American societies defines it as a combination of problem-solving skills, deductive reasoning skills, and Intelligence quotient (IQ), while other American societies point out that intelligent people should have a social conscience, accept others for who they are, and be able to give advice or wisdom.[106] Motivational intelligence[edit] Motivational intelligence refers to an individual's capacity to comprehend and utilize various motivations, such as the need for achievement, affiliation, or power. It involves understanding tacit knowledge related to these motivations. This concept encompasses the ability to recognize and appreciate the diverse values, behaviors, and cultural differences of others, driven by intrinsic interest rather than solely to enhance interaction effectiveness.[107][108] Research suggests a relationship between motivational intelligence, international experiences, and leadership. Individuals with higher levels of motivational intelligence tend to exhibit greater enthusiasm for learning about other cultures, thereby contributing to their effectiveness in cross-cultural settings. However, studies have also revealed variations in motivational intelligence across ethnicities, with Asian students demonstrating higher cognitive cultural intelligence but lower motivational intelligence compared to other groups.[109] Investigations have explored the impact of motivational intelligence on job motivation. A study conducted on employees of Isfahan Gas Company indicated a positive and significant relationship between motivational intelligence and two of its indicators, namely adaptability and social relationship, with job motivation. These findings highlight the potential influence of motivational intelligence on individuals' motivation levels within work contexts.[110] Motivational intelligence has been identified as a strong predictor, superseding knowledge intelligence, behavioral intelligence, and strategic intelligence. It holds a crucial role in promoting cooperation, which is considered the ideal and essential element of motivational intelligence. Therapeutic approaches grounded in motivational intelligence emphasize a collaborative partnership between the therapist and client. The therapist creates an environment conducive to change without imposing their views or attempting to force awareness or acceptance of reality onto the client.[111] Motivational intelligence encompasses the understanding of motivations, such as achievement, affiliation, and power, as well as the appreciation of cultural differences and values. It has been found to impact areas such as international experiences, leadership, job motivation, and cooperative therapeutic interventions.[112][113] See also[edit] Evolution of human intelligence Flynn effect   20th-century rise in intelligence test scores Genius   Exceptional intellectual ability, creativity, or originality Intellect   Faculty of the human mind Neuroscience and intelligence   Humans   Neurological factors responsible for intelligence Outline of human intelligence   Overview of and topical guide to human intelligence Self-test of Intelligence   psychological test that someone can take to measure one's own intelligencePages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback Sex differences in intelligence   Area of scientific research Superintelligence   Hypothetical agent surpassing human intelligence Theory of multiple intelligences   Educational model of human intelligence Volition (psychology)   Cognitive process of decision to act References[edit] ^ Salovey, Peter; Mayer, John D.

Naturally-occurring pubic, body, and facial hair have been deliberately removed to show anatomy. The human body is the entire structure of a human being. It is composed of many different types of cells that together create tissues and subsequently organs and then organ systems. The external human body consists of a head, hair, neck, torso (which includes the thorax and abdomen), genitals, arms, hands, legs, and feet. The internal human body includes organs, teeth, bones, muscle, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels and blood, lymphatic vessels and lymph. The study of the human body includes anatomy, physiology, histology and embryology. The body varies anatomically in known ways. Physiology focuses on the systems and organs of the human body and their functions. Many systems and mechanisms interact in order to maintain homeostasis, with safe levels of substances such as sugar, iron, and oxygen in the blood. The body is studied by health professionals, physiologists, anatomists, and artists to assist them in their work. Composition[edit] Main article: Composition of the human body Elements of the human body by mass. Trace elements are less than 1% combined (and each less than 0.1%). Element Symbol Percent mass Percent atoms Oxygen O 65.0 24.0 Carbon C 18.5 12.0 Hydrogen H 9.5 62.0 Nitrogen N 3.2 1.1 Calcium Ca 1.5 0.22 Phosphorus P 1.0 0.22 Potassium K 0.4 0.03 Sulfur S 0.3 0.038 Sodium Na 0.2 0.037 Chlorine Cl 0.2 0.024 Magnesium Mg 0.1 0.015 Trace elements < 0.1 < 0.3 The human body is composed of elements including hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, calcium and phosphorus. These elements reside in trillions of cells and non-cellular components of the body. The adult male body is about 60% total body water content of some 42 litres (9.2 imp gal; 11 US gal). This is made up of about 19 litres (4.2 imp gal; 5.0 US gal) of extracellular fluid including about 3.2 litres (0.70 imp gal; 0.85 US gal) of blood plasma and about 8.4 litres (1.8 imp gal; 2.2 US gal) of interstitial fluid, and about 23 litres (5.1 imp gal; 6.1 US gal) of fluid inside cells.[1] The content, acidity and composition of the water inside and outside cells is carefully maintained. The main electrolytes in body water outside cells are sodium and chloride, whereas within cells it is potassium and other phosphates.[2] Cells[edit] See also: List of distinct cell types in the adult human body The body contains trillions of cells, the fundamental unit of life. At maturity, there are roughly 30 trillion cells, and 38 trillion bacteria in the body,[3][4] an estimate arrived at by totaling the cell numbers of all the organs of the body and cell types. The skin of the body is also host to billions of commensal organisms as well as immune cells.[5] Not all parts of the body are made from cells. Cells sit in an extracellular matrix that consists of proteins such as collagen, surrounded by extracellular fluids. Each of the cells of the human body experiences, on average, tens of thousands of DNA damages per day.[6] These damages can block genome replication or genome transcription, and if they are not repaired or are repaired incorrectly, they may lead to mutations, or other genome alterations that threaten cell viability.[6] Genome[edit] Main article: Genome See also: Genetics Genome Cells in the body function because of DNA. DNA sits within the nucleus of a cell. Here, parts of DNA are copied and sent to the body of the cell via RNA.[7] The RNA is then used to create proteins, which form the basis for cells, their activity, and their products. Proteins dictate cell function and gene expression, a cell is able to self-regulate by the amount of proteins produced.[8] However, not all cells have DNA; some cells such as mature red blood cells lose their nucleus as they mature. Tissues[edit] Diagram of the different types of soft tissue in the body The body consists of many different types of tissue, defined as cells that act with a specialised function.[9] The study of tissues is called histology and is often done with a microscope. The body consists of four main types of tissues. These are lining cells (epithelia), connective tissue, nerve tissue and muscle tissue.[10] Cells[edit] Cells that line surfaces exposed to the outside world or gastrointestinal tract (epithelia) or internal cavities (endothelium) come in numerous shapes and forms   from single layers of flat cells, to cells with small beating hair-like cilia in the lungs, to column-like cells that line the stomach. Endothelial cells are cells that line internal cavities including blood vessels and glands. Lining cells regulate what can and cannot pass through them, protect internal structures, and function as sensory surfaces.[10] Organs[edit] See also: List of organs of the human body 1905 diagram of the internal organs of the human body Organs, structured collections of cells with a specific function,[11] mostly sit within the body, with the exception of skin. Examples include the heart, lungs and liver. Many organs reside within cavities within the body. These cavities include the abdomen (which contains the stomach, for example) and pleura, which contains the lungs. Heart[edit] Main article: Heart The heart is an organ located in the thoracic cavity between the lungs and slightly to the left. It is surrounded by the pericardium, which holds it in place in the mediastinum and serves to protect it from blunt trauma, infection and help lubricate the movement of the heart via pericardial fluid.[12] The heart works by pumping blood around the body allowing oxygen, nutrients, waste, hormones and white blood cells to be transported. Diagram of the human heart The heart is composed of two atria and two ventricles. The primary purpose of the atria is to allow uninterrupted venous blood flow to the heart during ventricular systole. This allows enough blood to get into the ventricles during atrial systole. Consequently, the atria allows a cardiac output roughly 75% greater than would be possible without them.[13] The purpose of the ventricles is to pump blood to the lungs through the right ventricle and to the rest of the body through the left ventricle.[14] The heart has an electrical conduction system to control the contraction and relaxation of the muscles. It starts in the sinoatrial node traveling through the atria causing them to pump blood into the ventricles. It then travels to the atrioventricular node, which makes the signal slow down slightly allowing the ventricles to fill with blood before pumping it out and starting the cycle over again.[15] Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, making up 16% of all deaths.[16] It is caused by the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries supplying the heart, eventually the arteries may become so narrow that not enough blood is able to reach the myocardium,[17] a condition known as myocardial infarction or heart attack, this can cause heart failure or cardiac arrest and eventually death.[18] Risk factors for coronary artery disease include obesity, smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, lack of exercise and diabetes.[19] Cancer can affect the heart, though it is exceedingly rare and has usually metastasized from another part of the body such as the lungs or breasts. This is because the heart cells quickly stop dividing and all growth occurs through size increase rather than cell division.[20] Gallbladder[edit] Main article: Gallbladder Gallbladder The gallbladder is a hollow pear-shaped organ located posterior to the inferior middle part of the right lobe of the liver. It is variable in shape and size. It stores bile before it is released into the small intestine via the common bile duct to help with digestion of fats. It receives bile from the liver via the cystic duct, which connects to the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.[21] The gallbladder gets its blood supply from the cystic artery, which in most people, emerges from the right hepatic artery.[21] Gallstones is a common disease in which one or more stones form in the gallbladder or biliary tract. Most people are asymptomatic but if a stone blocks the biliary tract, it causes a gallbladder attack, symptoms may include sudden pain in the upper right abdomen or center of the abdomen. Nausea and vomiting may also occur. Typical treatment is removal of the gallbladder through a procedure called a cholecystectomy.[22][23] Having gallstones is a risk factor for gallbladder cancer, which although quite uncommon, is rapidly fatal if not diagnosed early.[24] Systems[edit] See also: List of systems of the human body Circulatory system[edit] Main article: Circulatory system Diagram showing the circulatory system of the body The circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels (arteries, veins and capillaries). The heart propels the circulation of the blood, which serves as a "transportation system" to transfer oxygen, fuel, nutrients, waste products, immune cells and signaling molecules (i.e. hormones) from one part of the body to another. Paths of blood circulation within the human body can be divided into two circuits: the pulmonary circuit, which pumps blood to the lungs to receive oxygen and leave carbon dioxide, and the systemic circuit, which carries blood from the heart off to the rest of the body. The blood consists of fluid that carries cells in the circulation, including some that move from tissue to blood vessels and back, as well as the spleen and bone marrow.[25][26][27] Digestive system[edit] Main article: Digestive system Digestive system The digestive system consists of the mouth including the tongue and teeth, esophagus, stomach, (gastrointestinal tract, small and large intestines, and rectum), as well as the liver, pancreas, gallbladder, and salivary glands. It converts food into small, nutritional, non-toxic molecules for distribution and absorption into the body. These molecules take the form of proteins (which are broken down into amino acids), fats, vitamins and minerals (the last of which are mainly ionic rather than molecular). After being swallowed, food moves through the gastrointestinal tract by means of peristalsis: the systematic expansion and contraction of muscles to push food from one area to the next.[28][29] Digestion begins in the mouth, which chews food into smaller pieces for easier digestion. Then it is swallowed, and moves through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, food is mixed with gastric acids to allow the extraction of nutrients. What is left is called chyme; this then moves into the small intestine, which absorbs the nutrients and water from the chyme. What remains passes on to the large intestine, where it is dried to form feces; these are then stored in the rectum until they are expelled through the anus.[29] Endocrine system[edit] Main article: Endocrine system Endocrine system The endocrine system consists of the principal endocrine glands: the pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, pancreas, parathyroids, and gonads, but nearly all organs and tissues produce specific endocrine hormones as well. The endocrine hormones serve as signals from one body system to another regarding an enormous array of conditions, resulting in variety of changes of function.[30] Immune system[edit] Main article: Immune system Primary immune response The immune system consists of the white blood cells, the thymus, lymph nodes and lymph channels, which are also part of the lymphatic system. The immune system provides a mechanism for the body to distinguish its own cells and tissues from outside cells and substances and to neutralize or destroy the latter by using specialized proteins such as antibodies, cytokines, and toll-like receptors, among many others.[31] Skin Integumentary system[edit] Main article: Integumentary system The integumentary system consists of the covering of the body (the skin), including hair and nails as well as other functionally important structures such as the sweat glands and sebaceous glands. The skin provides containment, structure, and protection for other organs, and serves as a major sensory interface with the outside world.[32][33] Lymphatic system[edit] Main article: Lymphatic system Lymphatic system female The lymphatic system extracts, transports and metabolizes lymph, the fluid found in between cells. The lymphatic system is similar to the circulatory system in terms of both its structure and its most basic function, to carry a body fluid.[34] Musculoskeletal system[edit] Main article: Musculoskeletal system The musculoskeletal system consists of the human skeleton (which includes bones, ligaments, tendons, joints and cartilage) and attached muscles. It gives the body basic structure and the ability for movement. In addition to their structural role, the larger bones in the body contain bone marrow, the site of production of blood cells. Also, all bones are major storage sites for calcium and phosphate. This system can be split up into the muscular system and the skeletal system.[35] Nervous system[edit] Main article: Nervous system Nervous system The nervous system consists of the body's neurons and glial cells, which together form the nerves, ganglia and gray matter, which in turn form the brain and related structures. The brain is the organ of thought, emotion, memory, and sensory processing; it serves many aspects of communication and controls various systems and functions. The special senses consist of vision, hearing, taste, and smell. The eyes, ears, tongue, and nose gather information about the body's environment.[36] From a structural perspective, the nervous system is typically subdivided into two component parts: the central nervous system (CNS), composed of the brain and the spinal cord; and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), composed of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord. The CNS is mostly responsible for organizing motion, processing sensory information, thought, memory, cognition and other such functions.[37] It remains a matter of some debate whether the CNS directly gives rise to consciousness.[citation needed] The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is mostly responsible for gathering information with sensory neurons and directing body movements with motor neurons.[37] From a functional perspective, the nervous system is again typically divided into two component parts: the somatic nervous system (SNS) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The SNS is involved in voluntary functions like speaking and sensory processes. The ANS is involved in involuntary processes, such as digestion and regulating blood pressure.[38] The nervous system is subject to many different diseases. In epilepsy, abnormal electrical activity in the brain can cause seizures. In multiple sclerosis, the immune system attacks the nerve linings, damaging the nerves' ability to transmit signals. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a motor neuron disease which gradually reduces movement in patients. There are also many other diseases of the nervous system.[37] Reproductive system[edit] Main article: Human reproductive system Male gonad (testes, left) and female gonad (ovaries, right) The purpose of the reproductive system is to reproduce and nurture the growth of offspring. The functions include the production of germ cells and hormones.[39] The sex organs of the male reproductive system and the female reproductive system develops and mature at puberty. These systems include the internal and external genitalia. Internal gross anatomy of the female reproductive system Female puberty generally occurs between the ages of 9 and 13 and is characterized by ovulation and menstruation; the growth of secondary sex characteristics, such as growth of pubic and underarm hair, breast, uterine and vaginal growth, widening hips and increased height and weight, also occur during puberty.[40] Male puberty sees the further development of the penis and testicles.[41] The female inner sex organs are the two ovaries, their fallopian tubes, the uterus, and the cervix. At birth there are about 70,000 immature egg cells that degenerate until at puberty there are around 40,000. No more egg cells are produced. Hormones stimulate the beginning of menstruation, and the ongoing menstrual cycles.[40][42] The female external sex organs are the vulva (labia, clitoris, and vestibule).[43][40] The male external genitalia include the penis and scrotum that contains the testicles. The testicles are gonads that produce the sperm cells which are ejaculated in semen through the penis. Unlike the egg cells in the female, sperm cells are produced throughout life. Other internal sex organs are the epididymides, vasa deferentia, and some accessory glands. Diseases that affect the reproductive system include polycystic ovary syndrome,[44] a number of disorders of the testicles including testicular torsion,[45][46] and a number of sexually transmitted infections including syphilis, HIV, chlamydia, HPV and genital warts.[47][48] Cancer can affect most parts of the reproductive system including the penis, testicles, prostate, ovaries, cervix, vagina, fallopian, uterus and vulva.[49] Respiratory system[edit] Main article: Respiratory system The respiratory system consists of the nose, nasopharynx, trachea, and lungs. It brings oxygen from the air and excretes carbon dioxide and water back into the air. First, air is pulled through the trachea into the lungs by the diaphragm pushing down, which creates a vacuum. Air is briefly stored inside small sacs known as alveoli (sing.: alveolus) before being expelled from the lungs when the diaphragm contracts again. Each alveolus is surrounded by capillaries carrying deoxygenated blood, which absorbs oxygen out of the air and into the bloodstream.[50][51] For the respiratory system to function properly, there need to be as few impediments as possible to the movement of air within the lungs. Inflammation of the lungs and excess mucus are common sources of breathing difficulties.[51] In asthma, the respiratory system is persistently inflamed, causing wheezing or shortness of breath. Pneumonia occurs through infection of the alveoli, and may be caused by tuberculosis. Emphysema, commonly a result of smoking, is caused by damage to connections between the alveoli.[52] Urinary system[edit] Main article: Urinary system Female urinary system The urinary system consists of the two kidneys, two ureters, bladder, and urethra. It removes waste materials from the blood through urine, which carries a variety of waste molecules and excess ions and water out of the body. First, the kidneys filter the blood through their respective nephrons, removing waste products like urea, creatinine and maintaining the proper balance of electrolytes and turning the waste products into urine by combining them with water from the blood.[53] The kidneys filter about 150 quarts (170 liters) of blood daily, but most of it is returned to the blood stream with only 1-2 quarts (1-2 liters) ending up as urine,[54] which passes from the kidneys through the ureters into the bladder. The smooth muscles lining the ureter walls continuously tighten and relax through a process called peristalsis, forcing small amounts of urine into the bladder every 10 15 seconds. The bladder is a hollow balloon shaped organ located in the pelvis. It stores urine until the brain signals it to relax the urinary sphincter and release the urine into the urethra starting urination.[55] A normal bladder can hold up to 16 ounces (half a liter) for 3 5 hours comfortably. Numerous diseases affect the urinary system including kidney stones, which are formed when materials in the urine concentrate enough to form a solid mass, urinary tract infections, which are infections of the urinary tract and can cause pain when urinating, frequent urination and even death if left untreated. Renal failure occurs when the kidneys fail to adequately filter waste from the blood and can lead to death if not treated with dialysis or kidney transplantation.[56] Cancer can affect the bladder, kidneys, urethra and ureters, with the latter two being far more rare.[57] Anatomy[edit] Main articles: Outline of human anatomy and Anatomy Cavities of human body FMRI of healthy human brain Human anatomy is the study of the shape and form of the human body. The human body has four limbs (two arms and two legs), a head and a neck, which connect to the torso. The body's shape is determined by a strong skeleton made of bone and cartilage, surrounded by fat (adipose tissue), muscle, connective tissue, organs, and other structures. The spine at the back of the skeleton contains the flexible vertebral column, which surrounds the spinal cord, which is a collection of nerve fibres connecting the brain to the rest of the body. Nerves connect the spinal cord and brain to the rest of the body. All major bones, muscles, and nerves in the body are named, with the exception of anatomical variations such as sesamoid bones and accessory muscles. Blood vessels carry blood throughout the body, which moves because of the beating of the heart. Venules and veins collect blood low in oxygen from tissues throughout the body. These collect in progressively larger veins until they reach the body's two largest veins, the superior and inferior vena cava, which drain blood into the right side of the heart. From here, the blood is pumped into the lungs where it receives oxygen and drains back into the left side of the heart. From here, it is pumped into the body's largest artery, the aorta, and then progressively smaller arteries and arterioles until it reaches tissue. Here, blood passes from small arteries into capillaries, then small veins and the process begins again. Blood carries oxygen, waste products, and hormones from one place in the body to another. Blood is filtered at the kidneys and liver. The body consists of a number of body cavities, separated areas which house different organ systems. The brain and central nervous system reside in an area protected from the rest of the body by the blood brain barrier. The lungs sit in the pleural cavity. The intestines, liver, and spleen sit in the abdominal cavity. Height, weight, shape and other body proportions vary individually and with age and sex. Body shape is influenced by the distribution of bones, muscle and fat tissue.[58] Physiology[edit] Main articles: Outline of physiology and Physiology Human physiology is the study of how the human body functions. This includes the mechanical, physical, bioelectrical, and biochemical functions of humans in good health, from organs to the cells of which they are composed. The human body consists of many interacting systems of organs. These interact to maintain homeostasis, keeping the body in a stable state with safe levels of substances such as sugar and oxygen in the blood.[59] Each system contributes to homeostasis, of itself, other systems, and the entire body. Some combined systems are referred to by joint names. For example, the nervous system and the endocrine system operate together as the neuroendocrine system. The nervous system receives information from the body, and transmits this to the brain via nerve impulses and neurotransmitters. At the same time, the endocrine system releases hormones, such as to help regulate blood pressure and volume. Together, these systems regulate the internal environment of the body, maintaining blood flow, posture, energy supply, temperature, and acid balance (pH).[59] Development[edit] Main article: Development of the human body Baby being carried Development of the human body is the process of growth to maturity. The process begins with fertilisation, where an egg released from the ovary of a female is penetrated by sperm. The egg then lodges in the uterus, where an embryo and later fetus develop until birth. Growth and development occur after birth, and include both physical and psychological development, influenced by genetic, hormonal, environmental and other factors. Development and growth continue throughout life, through childhood, adolescence, and through adulthood to old age, and are referred to as the process of aging. Society and culture[edit] Professional study[edit] Further information: History of anatomy, History of medicine, and History of physiology Anatomical study by Leonardo da Vinci Health professionals learn about the human body from illustrations, models, and demonstrations. Medical and dental students in addition gain practical experience, for example by dissection of cadavers. Human anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry are basic medical sciences, generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school.[60][61][62] Depiction[edit] Main article: Depictions of nudity Figure drawing by Lovis Corinth (before 1925) In Western societies, the contexts for depictions of the human body include information, art and pornography. Information includes both science and education, such as anatomical drawings. Any ambiguous image not easily fitting into one of these categories may be misinterpreted, leading to disputes.[63] The most contentious disputes are between fine art and erotic images, which define the legal distinction of which images are permitted or prohibited. History of anatomy[edit] Main article: History of anatomy Two facing pages of text with woodcuts of naked male and female figures, in the Epitome by Andreas Vesalius, 1543 In Ancient Greece, the Hippocratic Corpus described the anatomy of the skeleton and muscles.[64] The 2nd century physician Galen of Pergamum compiled classical knowledge of anatomy into a text that was used throughout the Middle Ages.[65] In the Renaissance, Andreas Vesalius (1514 1564) pioneered the modern study of human anatomy by dissection, writing the influential book De humani corporis fabrica.[66][67] Anatomy advanced further with the invention of the microscope and the study of the cellular structure of tissues and organs.[68] Modern anatomy uses techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, fluoroscopy and ultrasound imaging to study the body in unprecedented detail.[69] History of physiology[edit] Main article: History of physiology The study of human physiology began with Hippocrates in Ancient Greece, around 420 BCE, and with Aristotle (384 322 BCE) who applied critical thinking and emphasis on the relationship between structure and function. Galen (c. 126   c. 199) was the first to use experiments to probe the body's functions.[70] The term physiology was introduced by the French physician Jean Fernel (1497 1558). In the 17th century, William Harvey (1578 1657) described the circulatory system, pioneering the combination of close observation with careful experiment.[71] In the 19th century, physiological knowledge began to accumulate at a rapid rate with the cell theory of Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann in 1838, that organisms are made up of cells. Claude Bernard (1813 1878) created the concept of the milieu interieur (internal environment), which Walter Cannon (1871 1945) later said was regulated to a steady state in homeostasis. In the 20th century, the physiologists Knut Schmidt-Nielsen and George Bartholomew extended their studies to comparative physiology and ecophysiology.[72] Most recently, evolutionary physiology has become a distinct subdiscipline.[73] See also[edit] Biology portalMedicine portal Anatomical model   Three-dimensional representation of human or animal anatomy Body image   Aesthetic perception of one's own body Cell physiology   Study of cell activity Comparative anatomy   Study of similarities and differences in the anatomy of different species Comparative physiology   Study of the diversity of functional characteristics of organisms.

languages Add topicControl of fire by early humans - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Aspect of human history "Control of fire" redirects here. For the process of suppressing or extinguishing a fire, see Fire control. For components that assist weapon systems, see Fire-control system. Not to be confused with Controlled burn. The control of fire by early humans was a critical technology enabling the evolution of humans. Fire provided a source of warmth and lighting, protection from predators (especially at night), a way to create more advanced hunting tools, and a method for cooking food. These cultural advances allowed human geographic dispersal, cultural innovations, and changes to diet and behavior. Additionally, creating fire allowed human activity to continue into the dark and colder hours of the evening. Claims for the earliest definitive evidence of control of fire by a member of Homo range from 1.7 to 2.0 million years ago (Mya).[1] Evidence for the "microscopic traces of wood ash" as controlled use of fire by Homo erectus, beginning roughly 1 million years ago, has wide scholarly support.[2][3] Some of the earliest known traces of controlled fire were found at the Daughters of Jacob Bridge, Israel, and dated to ~790,000 years ago.[4][5] At the site, archaeologists also found the oldest likely evidence of controlled use of fire to cook food ~780,000 years ago.[6][7] However, some studies suggest cooking started ~1.8 million years ago.[8][9][clarification needed] Flint blades burned in fires roughly 300,000 years ago were found near fossils of early but not entirely modern Homo sapiens in Morocco.[10] Fire was used regularly and systematically by early modern humans to heat treat silcrete stone to increase its flake-ability for the purpose of toolmaking approximately 164,000 years ago at the South African site of Pinnacle Point.[11] Evidence of widespread control of fire by anatomically modern humans dates to approximately 125,000 years ago.[12] Control of fire[edit] How (and when) did humans first make fire? - archaeologist Andrew Sorensen (Leiden University) The use and control of fire was a gradual process proceeding through more than one stage. One was a change in habitat, from dense forest, where wildfires were rare but difficult to escape, to savanna (mixed grass/woodland) where wildfires were common but easier to survive. Such a change may have occurred about 3 million years ago, when the savanna expanded in East Africa due to cooler and drier climate.[13][14] The next stage involved interaction with burned landscapes and foraging in the wake of wildfires, as observed in various wild animals.[13][14] In the African savanna, animals that preferentially forage in recently burned areas include savanna chimpanzees (a variety of Pan troglodytes verus),[13][15] vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops)[16] and a variety of birds, some of which also hunt insects and small vertebrates in the wake of grass fires.[15][17] The next step would be to make some use of residual hot spots that occur in the wake of wildfires. For example, foods found in the wake of wildfires tend to be either burned or undercooked. This might have provided incentives to place undercooked foods on a hotspot or to pull food out of the fire if it was in danger of getting burned. This would require familiarity with fire and its behavior.[18][14] An early step in the control of fire would have been transporting it from burned to unburned areas and lighting them on fire, providing advantages in food acquisition.[14] Maintaining a fire over an extended period of time, as for a season (such as the dry season), may have led to the development of base campsites. Building a hearth or other fire enclosure such as a circle of stones would have been a later development.[19] The ability to make fire, generally with a friction device with hardwood rubbing against softwood (as in a bow drill), was a later development.[13] Each of these stages could occur at different intensities, ranging from occasional or "opportunistic" to "habitual" to "obligate" (unable to survive without it).[14][19] Lower Paleolithic evidence[edit] Hominin timelineThis box: viewtalkedit 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  MiocenePliocenePleistoceneHomininiNakalipithecusSamburupithecusOuranopithecus(Ou. turkae)(Ou. macedoniensis)ChororapithecusOreopithecusSivapithecusSahelanthropusGraecopithecusOrrorin(O. praegens)(O. tugenensis)Ardipithecus(Ar. kadabba)(Ar. ramidus)Australopithecus(Au. africanus)(Au. afarensis)(Au. anamensis)H. habilis(H. rudolfensis)(Au. garhi)H. erectus(H. antecessor)(H. ergaster)(Au. sediba)H. heidelbergensisHomo sapiensNeanderthalsDenisovans  Earlier apes Gorilla split Chimpanzee split Earliest bipedal Earliest sign of Ardipithecus Earliest sign of Australopithecus Earliest stone tools Earliest sign of Homo Dispersal beyond Africa Earliest language Earliest fire / cooking Earliest rock art Earliest clothes Modern humansH o m i n i d sP a r a n t h r o p u s(million years ago) Most of the evidence of controlled use of fire during the Lower Paleolithic is uncertain and has limited scholarly support.[3] Some of the evidence is inconclusive because other plausible explanations, such as natural processes, exist for the findings.[1] Findings support that the earliest known controlled use of fire took place in Wonderwerk Cave, South Africa, 1.0 Mya.[3][20] Africa[edit] Findings from Wonderwerk provide the earliest evidence for controlled use of fire. Intact sediments were analyzed using micromorphological analysis. Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (mFTIR) yielded evidence, in the form of burned bones and ashed plant remains, that burning took place at the site 1.0 Mya.[3] East African sites, such as Chesowanja near Lake Baringo, Koobi Fora, and Olorgesailie in Kenya, show possible evidence that fire was controlled by early humans.[1] In Chesowanja, archaeologists found red clay clasts dated to 1.4 Mya. These clasts must have been heated to 400  C (750  F) to harden. However, tree stumps burned in bush fires in East Africa produce clasts, which, when broken by erosion, are like those described at Chesownja. Controlled use of fire at Chesowanja is unproven.[1] In Koobi Fora, sites show evidence of control of fire by Homo erectus at 1.5 Mya with findings of reddened sediment that could come from heating at 200 400  C (400 750  F).[1] Evidence of possible human control of fire, found at Swartkrans, South Africa,[21] includes burned bones, including ones with hominin-inflicted cut marks, along with Acheulean and bone tools.[1] This site shows some of the earliest evidence of carnivorous behavior in H. erectus. A "hearth-like depression" that could have been used to burn bones was found in Olorgesailie, Kenya. However, it did not contain any charcoal, and no signs of fire have been observed. Some microscopic charcoal was found, but it could have resulted from a natural brush fire.[1] In Gadeb, Ethiopia, fragments of welded tuff that appeared to have been burned were found in Locality 8E but refiring of the rocks might have occurred due to local volcanic activity.[1] In the Middle Awash River Valley, cone-shaped depressions of reddish clay were found that could have been formed by temperatures of 200  C (400  F). These features, thought to have been created by burning tree stumps, were hypothesized to have been produced by early hominids lighting tree stumps so they could have fire away from their habitation site. This view is not widely accepted, though.[1] Burned stones were found in Awash Valley, but volcanic welded tuff is found in the area, which could explain the burned stones.[1] Burned flints discovered near Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, dated by thermoluminescence to around 300,000 years old, were discovered in the same sedimentary layer as skulls of early Homo sapiens. Paleoanthropologist Jean-Jacques Hublin believes the flints were used as spear tips and left in fires used by the early humans for cooking food.[10] Asia[edit] In Xihoudu in Shanxi Province, China, the black, blue, and grayish-green discoloration of mammalian bones found at the site illustrates evidence of burning by early hominids. In 1985, at a parallel site in China, Yuanmou in Yunnan Province, archaeologists found blackened mammal bones that date back to 1.7 Mya.[1] Middle East[edit] A site at Bnot Ya'akov Bridge, Israel, has been claimed to show that H. erectus or H. ergaster controlled fires between 790,000 and 690,000 BP.[22] An AI-powered spectroscopy helped researchers unearth evidence of the use of fire dating 800,000 and 1 million years ago.[23] In an article published in June 2022,[24] researchers from Weizmann Institute of Science, along with researchers at the University of Toronto and Hebrew University of Jerusalem described the use of deep learning models to analyze heat exposure of 26 flint tools that were found in 1970s at the Evron Quarry in the northwest of Israel. The results showed the tools were heated up to 600 C.[23] Southeast Asia[edit] At Trinil, Java, burned wood has been found in layers that carried H. erectus (Java Man) fossils dating from 830,000 to 500,000 BP.[1] The burned wood has been claimed to indicate the use of fire by early hominids. Middle Paleolithic evidence[edit] Africa[edit] The Cave of Hearths in South Africa has burn deposits, which date from 700,000 to 200,000 BP, as do various other sites such as Montagu Cave (200,000 to 58,000 BP) and the Klasies River Mouth (130,000 to 120,000 BP).[1] Strong evidence comes from Kalambo Falls in Zambia, where several artifacts related to the use of fire by humans have been recovered, including charred logs, charcoal, carbonized grass stems and plants, and wooden implements, which may have been hardened by fire. The site has been dated through radiocarbon dating to 180,000 BP, through amino-acid racemization.[1] Fire was used for heat treatment of silcrete stones to increase their workability before they were knapped into tools by Stillbay culture in South Africa.[25][26][27] These Stillbay sites date back from 164,000 to 72,000 years ago, with the heat treatment of stone beginning by about 164,000 years ago.[25] Asia[edit] Zhoukoudian Caves, a World Heritage Site and an early site of human use of fire in China Evidence at Zhoukoudian cave in China suggests control of fire as early as 460,000 to 230,000 BP.[12] Fire in Zhoukoudian is suggested by the presence of burned bones, burned chipped-stone artifacts, charcoal, ash, and hearths alongside H. erectus fossils in Layer 10, the earliest archaeological horizon at the site.[1][28] This evidence comes from Locality 1, also known as the Peking Man site, where several bones were found to be uniformly black to grey. The bone extracts were determined to be characteristic of burned bone rather than manganese staining. These residues also showed IR spectra for oxides, and a turquoise bone was reproduced in the laboratory by heating some of the other bones found in Layer 10. The same effect might have been at the site due to natural heating, as the effect was produced on white, yellow, and black bones.[28] Layer 10 is ash with biologically produced silicon, aluminum, iron, and potassium, but wood ash remnants such as siliceous aggregates are missing. Among these are possible hearths "represented by finely laminated silt and clay interbedded with reddish-brown and yellow-brown fragments of organic matter, locally mixed with limestone fragments and dark brown finely laminated silt, clay, and organic matter."[28] The site itself does not show that fires were made in Zhoukoudian, but the association of blackened bones with quartzite artifacts at least shows that humans did control fire at the time of the habitation of the Zhoukoudian cave.[citation needed] Middle East[edit] At the Amudian site of Qesem Cave, near the city of Kfar Qasim, Israel, evidence exists of the regular use of fire from before 382,000 BP to around 200,000 BP, at the end of Lower Pleistocene. Large quantities of burned bone and moderately heated soil lumps were found, and the cut marks found on the bones suggest that butchering and prey-defleshing took place near fireplaces.[29] In addition, hominins living in Qesem cave managed to heat their flint to varying temperatures before knapping it into different tools.[30] Indian Subcontinent[edit] The earliest evidence for controlled fire use by humans on the Indian subcontinent, dating to between 50,000 and 55,000 years ago, comes from the Main Belan archaeological site, located in the Belan River valley in Uttar Pradesh, India.[31] Europe[edit] Multiple sites in Europe, such as Torralba and Ambrona, Spain, and St. Esteve-Janson, France, have also shown evidence of the use of fire by later versions of H. erectus. The oldest has been found in England at the site of Beeches Pit, Suffolk; uranium series dating and thermoluminescence dating place the use of fire at 415,000 BP.[32] At V rtessz l s, Hungary, while no charcoal has been found, burned bones have been discovered dating from c. 350,000 years ago. At Torralba and Ambrona, Spain, objects such as Acheulean stone tools, remains of large mammals such as extinct elephants, charcoal, and wood were discovered.[1] At Terra Amata in France, there is a fireplace with ashes (dated between 380,000 BP and 230,000 BP). At Saint-Est ve-Janson in France, there is evidence of five hearths and reddened earth in the Escale Cave; these hearths have been dated to 200,000 BP.[1] Evidence for fire making dates to at least the Middle Paleolithic, with dozens of Neanderthal hand axes from France exhibiting use-wear traces suggesting these tools were struck with the mineral pyrite to produce sparks around 50,000 years ago.[33] Impact on human evolution[edit] Cultural innovation[edit] Uses of fire by early humans[edit] The discovery of fire provided various uses for early hominids. Its warmth kept them alive during low nighttime temperatures in colder environments, allowing geographic expansion from tropical and subtropical climates to temperate areas. Its blaze warded off predatory animals, especially in the dark.[34] Fire also played a major role in changing food habits. Cooking allowed a significant increase in meat consumption and calorie intake.[34] It was soon discovered that meat could be dried and smoked by fire, preserving it for lean seasons.[35] Fire was even used in manufacturing tools for hunting and butchering.[36] Hominids also learned that starting bushfires to burn large areas could increase land fertility and clear terrain to make hunting easier.[35][37] Evidence shows that early hominids were able to corral and trap prey animals using fire.[citation needed] Fire was used to clear out caves before living in them, helping to begin the use of shelter.[38] The many uses of fire may have led to specialized social roles, such as the separation of cooking from hunting.[39] The control of fire enabled important changes in human behavior, health, energy expenditure, and geographic expansion. After the loss of body hair, hominids could move into much colder regions that would have previously been uninhabitable. Evidence of more complex management to change biomes can be found as far back as 200,000 to 100,000 years ago, at minimum. Tool and weapon making[edit] Fire allowed major innovations in tool and weapon manufacture. Evidence dating to roughly 164,000 years ago indicates that early humans in South Africa during the Middle Stone Age used fire to alter the mechanical properties of tool materials applying heat treatment to a fine-grained rock called silcrete.[40] The heated rocks were then tempered into crescent-shaped blades or arrowheads for hunting and butchering prey. This may have been the first time that bow and arrow were used for hunting, with far-ranging impact.[40][41] Art and ceramics[edit] Fire was used in the creation of art. Archaeologists have discovered several 1- to 10-inch Venus figurine statues in Europe dating to the Paleolithic, several carved from stone and ivory, others shaped from clay and then fired. These are some of the earliest examples of ceramics.[42] Fire was also commonly used to create pottery. Although pottery was formerly thought to have begun with the Neolithic around 10,000 years ago, scientists in China discovered pottery fragments in the Xianrendong Cave that were about 20,000 years old.[43] During the Neolithic Age and agricultural revolution about 10,000 years ago, pottery became far more common and widespread, often carved and painted with simple linear designs and geometric shapes.[44] Social development and nighttime activity[edit] Fire was an important factor in expanding and developing societies of early hominids. One impact fire might have had was social stratification. The power to make and wield fire may have conferred prestige and social position.[35] Fire also led to a lengthening of daytime activities and allowed more nighttime activities.[45] Evidence of large hearths indicate that the majority of nighttime was spent around the fire.[46] The increased social interaction from gathering around the fire may have fostered the development of language.[45] Another effect of fire use on hominid societies was that it required larger groups to work together to maintain the fire, finding fuel, portioning it onto the fire, and re-igniting it when necessary. These larger groups might have included older individuals, such as grandparents, who helped to care for children. Ultimately, fire significantly influenced the size and social interactions of early hominid communities.[45][46] Exposure to artificial light during later hours of the day changed humans' circadian rhythms, contributing to a longer waking day.[47] The modern human's waking day is 16 hours, while many mammals are only awake for half as many hours.[46] Additionally, humans are most awake during the early evening hours, while other primates' days begin at dawn and end at sundown. Many of these behavioral changes can be attributed to the control of fire and its impact on daylight extension.[46] The cooking hypothesis[edit] The cooking hypothesis proposes that the ability to cook allowed for the brain size of hominids to increase over time. This idea was first presented by Friedrich Engels in the article "The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man" and later recapitulated in the book Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human by Richard Wrangham and then in a book by Suzana Herculano-Houzel.[48] Critics of the hypothesis argue that cooking with controlled fire was insufficient to start the increasing brain size trend. The cooking hypothesis gains support by comparing the nutrients in raw food to the much more easily digested nutrients in cooked food, as in an examination of protein ingestion from raw vs. cooked egg.[49] Scientists have found that among several primates, the restriction of feeding to raw foods during daylight hours limits the metabolic energy available.[50] Genus Homo was able to break through the limit by cooking food to shorten their feeding times and be able to absorb more nutrients to accommodate the increasing need for energy.[51] In addition, scientists argue that the Homo species was also able to obtain nutrients like docosahexaenoic acid from algae that were especially beneficial and critical for brain evolution. The detoxification of food by the cooking process enabled early humans to access these resources.[52] Besides the brain, other human organs also demand a high metabolism.[51] During human evolution, the body-mass proportion of different organs changed to allow brain expansion. Changes to diet[edit] Before the advent of fire, the hominid diet was limited to mostly plant parts composed of simple sugars and carbohydrates such as seeds, flowers, and fleshy fruits. Parts of the plant, such as stems, mature leaves, enlarged roots, and tubers, would have been inaccessible as a food source due to the indigestibility of raw cellulose and starch. Cooking, however, made starchy and fibrous foods edible and greatly increased the diversity of other foods available to early humans. Toxin-containing foods, including seeds and similar carbohydrate sources, such as cyanogenic glycosides found in linseed and cassava, were incorporated into their diets as cooking rendered them nontoxic.[53] Cooking could also kill parasites, reduce the amount of energy required for chewing and digestion, and release more nutrients from plants and meat. Due to the difficulty of chewing raw meat and digesting tough proteins (e.g. collagen) and carbohydrates, the development of cooking served as an effective mechanism to process meat efficiently and allow for its consumption in larger quantities. With its high caloric density and content of important nutrients, meat thus became a staple in the diet of early humans.[54] By increasing digestibility, cooking allowed hominids to maximize the energy gained from consuming foods. Studies show that caloric intake from cooking starches improves 12-35% and 45-78% for protein. As a result of the increases in net energy gain from food consumption, survival and reproductive rates in hominids increased.[55] Through lowering food toxicity and increasing nutritive yield, cooking allowed for an earlier weaning age, permitting females to have more children.[56] In this way, too, it facilitated population growth. It has been proposed that the use of fire for cooking caused environmental toxins to accumulate in the placenta, which led to a species-wide taboo on human placentophagy around the time of the mastery of fire. Placentophagy is common in other primates.[57] Biological changes[edit] Before their use of fire, the hominid species had large premolars, which were used to chew harder foods, such as large seeds. In addition, due to the shape of the molar cusps, the diet is inferred to have been more leaf- or fruit-based. Probably in response to consuming cooked foods, the molar teeth of H. erectus gradually shrank, suggesting that their diet had changed from more challenging foods such as crisp root vegetables to softer cooked foods such as meat.[58][59] Cooked foods further selected for the differentiation of their teeth and eventually led to a decreased jaw volume with a variety of smaller teeth in hominids. Today, a smaller jaw volume and teeth size of humans is seen in comparison to other primates.[60] Due to the increased digestibility of many cooked foods, less digestion was needed to procure the necessary nutrients. As a result, the gastrointestinal tract and organs in the digestive system decreased in size. This is in contrast to other primates, where a larger digestive tract is needed for the fermentation of long carbohydrate chains. Thus, humans evolved from the large colons and tracts that are seen in other primates to smaller ones.[61] According to Wrangham, fire control allowed hominids to sleep on the ground and in caves instead of trees and led to more time spent on the ground. This may have contributed to the evolution of bipedalism, as such an ability became increasingly necessary for human activity.[62] Criticism[edit] Critics of the hypothesis argue that while a linear increase in brain volume of the genus Homo is seen over time, adding fire control and cooking does not add anything meaningful to the data. Species such as H. ergaster existed with large brain volumes during periods with little to no evidence of fire for cooking. Little variation exists in the brain sizes of H. erectus dated from periods of weak and strong evidence for cooking.[46] An experiment involving mice fed raw versus cooked meat found that cooking meat did not increase the amount of calories taken up by mice, leading to the study's conclusion that the energetic gain is the same, if not greater, in raw meat diets than cooked meats.[63] Studies such as this and others have led to criticisms of the hypothesis that state that the increases in human brain size occurred well before the advent of cooking due to a shift away from the consumption of nuts and berries to the consumption of meat.[64][65] Other anthropologists argue that the evidence suggests that cooking fires began in earnest only 250,000 BP, when ancient hearths, earth ovens, burned animal bones, and flint appear across Europe and the Middle East.[66] See also[edit] Evolutionary biology portalScience portal Hunting hypothesis Savannah hypothesis Theft of fire References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q James, Steven R.

"Uncivilised" redirects here. For the novel and film, see Uncivilised (novel) and Uncivilised (film). The ancient Sumerians of Mesopotamia were the oldest civilization in the world, beginning about 4000 BCE, here depicted around 2500 BCE, showing the different social roles in the Sumerian society of Ur. Ancient Egypt is an example of one of the first civilizations, building pyramids starting in the 3rd millennium BCE.[1] A civilization (also spelled civilisation in British English) is any complex society characterized by the development of the state, social stratification, urbanization, and symbolic systems of communication beyond signed or spoken languages (namely, writing systems).[2][3][4][5][6] Civilizations are organized around densely-populated settlements, divided into more or less rigid hierarchical social classes of division of labour, often with a ruling elite and a subordinate urban and rural populations, which engage in intensive agriculture, mining, small-scale manufacture and trade. Civilization concentrates power, extending human control over the rest of nature, including over other human beings.[7] Civilizations are characterized by elaborate agriculture, architecture, infrastructure, technological advancement, currency, taxation, regulation, and specialization of labour.[5][6][8] Historically, a civilization has often been understood as a larger and "more advanced" culture, in implied contrast to smaller, supposedly less advanced cultures,[9][10][11][12] even societies within civilizations themselves and within their histories. Generally civilization contrasts with non-centralized tribal societies, including the cultures of nomadic pastoralists, Neolithic societies, or hunter-gatherers. The word civilization relates to the Latin civitas or 'city'. As the National Geographic Society has explained it: "This is why the most basic definition of the word civilization is 'a society made up of cities.'"[13] The earliest emergence of civilizations is generally connected with the final stages of the Neolithic Revolution in West Asia, culminating in the relatively rapid process of urban revolution and state formation, a political development associated with the appearance of a governing elite. History of the concept[edit] The End of Dinner by Jules-Alexandre Gr n (1913). The emergence of table manners and other forms of etiquette and self-restraint are presented as a characteristic of civilized society by Norbert Elias in his book The Civilizing Process (1939). The English word civilization comes from the French civilis  ('civilized'), from Latin: civilis ('civil'), related to civis ('citizen') and civitas ('city').[14] The fundamental treatise is Norbert Elias's The Civilizing Process (1939), which traces social mores from medieval courtly society to the early modern period.[a] In The Philosophy of Civilization (1923), Albert Schweitzer outlines two opinions: one purely material and the other material and ethical. He said that the world crisis was from humanity losing the ethical idea of civilization, "the sum total of all progress made by man in every sphere of action and from every point of view in so far as the progress helps towards the spiritual perfecting of individuals as the progress of all progress".[16] Related words like "civility" developed in the mid-16th century. The abstract noun "civilization", meaning "civilized condition", came in the 1760s, again from French. The first known use in French is in 1757, by Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau, and the first use in English is attributed to Adam Ferguson, who in his 1767 Essay on the History of Civil Society wrote, "Not only the individual advances from infancy to manhood but the species itself from rudeness to civilisation".[17] The word was therefore opposed to barbarism or rudeness, in the active pursuit of progress characteristic of the Age of Enlightenment. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, during the French Revolution, "civilization" was used in the singular, never in the plural, and meant the progress of humanity as a whole. This is still the case in French.[18] The use of "civilizations" as a countable noun was in occasional use in the 19th century,[b] but has become much more common in the later 20th century, sometimes just meaning culture (itself in origin an uncountable noun, made countable in the context of ethnography).[19] Only in this generalized sense does it become possible to speak of a "medieval civilization", which in Elias's sense would have been an oxymoron. Using the terms "civilization" and "culture" as equivalents are controversial and generally rejected so that for example some types of culture are not normally described as civilizations.[20] Already in the 18th century, civilization was not always seen as an improvement. One historically important distinction between culture and civilization is from the writings of Rousseau, particularly his work about education, Emile. Here, civilization, being more rational and socially driven, is not fully in accord with human nature, and "human wholeness is achievable only through the recovery of or approximation to an original discursive or pre-rational natural unity" (see noble savage). From this, a new approach was developed, especially in Germany, first by Johann Gottfried Herder and later by philosophers such as Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. This sees cultures as natural organisms, not defined by "conscious, rational, deliberative acts", but a kind of pre-rational "folk spirit". Civilization, in contrast, though more rational and more successful in material progress, is unnatural and leads to "vices of social life" such as guile, hypocrisy, envy and avarice.[18] In World War II, Leo Strauss, having fled Germany, argued in New York that this opinion of civilization was behind Nazism and German militarism and nihilism.[21] Characteristics[edit] The Acropolis of Athens: Greece is traditionally seen as the cradle of a distinct European or "Western" civilization.[22][23] Social scientists such as V. Gordon Childe have named a number of traits that distinguish a civilization from other kinds of society.[24][25] Civilizations have been distinguished by their means of subsistence, types of livelihood, settlement patterns, forms of government, social stratification, economic systems, literacy and other cultural traits. Andrew Nikiforuk argues that "civilizations relied on shackled human muscle. It took the energy of slaves to plant crops, clothe emperors, and build cities" and considers slavery to be a common feature of pre-modern civilizations.[26] All civilizations have depended on agriculture for subsistence, with the possible exception of some early civilizations in Peru which may have depended upon maritime resources.[27][28] The traditional "surplus model" postulates that cereal farming results in accumulated storage and a surplus of food, particularly when people use intensive agricultural techniques such as artificial fertilization, irrigation and crop rotation. It is possible but more difficult to accumulate horticultural production, and so civilizations based on horticultural gardening have been very rare.[29] Grain surpluses have been especially important because grain can be stored for a long time. Research from the Journal of Political Economy contradicts the surplus model. It postulates that horticultural gardening was more productive than cereal farming. However, only cereal farming produced civilization because of the appropriability of yearly harvest. Rural populations that could only grow cereals could be taxed allowing for a taxing elite and urban development. This also had a negative effect on rural population, increasing relative agricultural output per farmer. Farming efficiency created food surplus and sustained the food surplus through decreasing rural population growth in favour of urban growth. Suitability of highly productive roots and tubers was in fact a curse of plenty, which prevented the emergence of states and impeded economic development.[30][31] A surplus of food permits some people to do things besides producing food for a living: early civilizations included soldiers, artisans, priests and priestesses, and other people with specialized careers. A surplus of food results in a division of labour and a more diverse range of human activity, a defining trait of civilizations. However, in some places hunter-gatherers have had access to food surpluses, such as among some of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest and perhaps during the Mesolithic Natufian culture. It is possible that food surpluses and relatively large scale social organization and division of labour predates plant and animal domestication.[32] Civilizations have distinctly different settlement patterns from other societies. The word civilization is sometimes defined as "living in cities".[33] Non-farmers tend to gather in cities to work and to trade. Compared with other societies, civilizations have a more complex political structure, namely the state.[34] State societies are more stratified[35] than other societies; there is a greater difference among the social classes. The ruling class, normally concentrated in the cities, has control over much of the surplus and exercises its will through the actions of a government or bureaucracy. Morton Fried, a conflict theorist and Elman Service, an integration theorist, have classified human cultures based on political systems and social inequality. This system of classification contains four categories.[36] Hunter-gatherer bands, which are generally egalitarian.[37] Horticultural pastoralist societies in which there are generally two inherited social classes: chief and commoner. Highly stratified structures, or chiefdoms, with several inherited social classes: king, noble, freemen, serf and slave. Civilizations, with complex social hierarchies and organized, institutional forms of government.[38] Economically, civilizations display more complex patterns of ownership and exchange than less organized societies. Living in one place allows people to accumulate more personal possessions than nomadic people. Some people also acquire landed property, or private ownership of the land. Because a percentage of people in civilizations do not grow their own food, they must trade their goods and services for food in a market system, or receive food through the levy of tribute, redistributive taxation, tariffs or tithes from the food producing segment of the population. Early human cultures functioned through a gift economy supplemented by limited barter systems. By the early Iron Age, contemporary civilizations developed money as a medium of exchange for increasingly complex transactions. In a village, the potter makes a pot for the brewer and the brewer compensates the potter by giving him a certain amount of beer. In a city, the potter may need a new roof, the roofer may need new shoes, the cobbler may need new horseshoes, the blacksmith may need a new coat and the tanner may need a new pot. These people may not be personally acquainted with one another and their needs may not occur all at the same time. A monetary system is a way of organizing these obligations to ensure that they are fulfilled. From the days of the earliest monetarized civilizations, monopolistic controls of monetary systems have benefited the social and political elites. The transition from simpler to more complex economies does not necessarily mean an improvement in the living standards of the populace. For example, although the Middle Ages is often portrayed as an era of decline from the Roman Empire, studies have shown that the average stature of males in the Middle Ages (c. 500 to 1500 CE) was greater than it was for males during the preceding Roman Empire and the succeeding Early Modern Period (c. 1500 to 1800 CE).[39][40] Also, the Plains Indians of North America in the 19th century were taller than their "civilized" American and European counterparts. The average stature of a population is a good measurement of the adequacy of its access to necessities, especially food, and its freedom from disease.[41] Writing, developed first by people in Sumer, is considered a hallmark of civilization and "appears to accompany the rise of complex administrative bureaucracies or the conquest state".[42] Traders and bureaucrats relied on writing to keep accurate records. Like money, the writing was necessitated by the size of the population of a city and the complexity of its commerce among people who are not all personally acquainted with each other. However, writing is not always necessary for civilization, as shown by the Inca civilization of the Andes, which did not use writing at all but except for a complex recording system consisting of knotted strings of different lengths and colours: the "Quipus", and still functioned as a civilized society. Aristotle, the Ancient Greek philosopher and scientist Aided by their division of labour and central government planning, civilizations have developed many other diverse cultural traits. These include organized religion, development in the arts, and countless new advances in science and technology. Assessments of what level of civilization a polity has reached are based on comparisons of the relative importance of agricultural as opposed to trading or manufacturing capacities, the territorial extensions of its power, the complexity of its division of labour, and the carrying capacity of its urban centres. Secondary elements include a developed transportation system, writing, standardized measurement, currency, contractual and tort-based legal systems, art, architecture, mathematics, scientific understanding, metallurgy, political structures, and organized religion. As a contrast with other societies[edit] The idea of civilization implies a progression or development from a previous "uncivilized" state. Traditionally, cultures that defined themselves as "civilized" often did so in contrast to other societies or human groupings viewed as less civilized, calling the latter barbarians, savages, and primitives. Indeed, the modern Western idea of civilization developed as a contrast to the indigenous cultures European settlers encountered during the European colonization of the Americas and Australia.[43] The term "primitive," though once used in anthropology, has now been largely condemned by anthropologists because of its derogatory connotations and because it implies that the cultures it refers to are relics of a past time that do not change or progress.[44] Because of this, societies regarding themselves as "civilized" have sometimes sought to dominate and assimilate "uncivilized" cultures into a "civilized" way of living.[45] In the 19th century, the idea of European culture as "civilized" and superior to "uncivilized" non-European cultures was fully developed, and civilization became a core part of European identity.[46] The idea of civilization can also be used as a justification for dominating another culture and dispossessing a people of their land. For example, in Australia, British settlers justified the displacement of Indigenous Australians by observing that the land appeared uncultivated and wild, which to them reflected that the inhabitants were not civilized enough to "improve" it.[43] The behaviours and modes of subsistence that characterize civilization have been spread by colonization, invasion, religious conversion, the extension of bureaucratic control and trade, and by the introduction of new technologies to cultures that did not previously have them. Though aspects of culture associated with civilization can be freely adopted through contact between cultures, since early modern times Eurocentric ideals of "civilization" have been widely imposed upon cultures through coercion and dominance. These ideals complemented a philosophy that assumed there were innate differences between "civilized" and "uncivilized" peoples.[46] Cultural identity[edit] Further information: Cultural area and culture "Civilization" can also refer to the culture of a complex society, not just the society itself. Every society, civilization or not, has a specific set of ideas and customs, and a certain set of manufactures and arts that make it unique. Civilizations tend to develop intricate cultures, including a state-based decision-making apparatus, a literature, professional art, architecture, organized religion and complex customs of education, coercion and control associated with maintaining the elite. The intricate culture associated with civilization has a tendency to spread to and influence other cultures, sometimes assimilating them into the civilization, a classic example being Chinese civilization and its influence on nearby civilizations such as Korea, Japan and Vietnam[47] Many civilizations are actually large cultural spheres containing many nations and regions. The civilization in which someone lives is that person's broadest cultural identity.[48][49] A Blue Shield International mission in Libya during the war in 2011 to protect the cultural assets there. It is precisely the protection of this cultural identity that is becoming increasingly important nationally and internationally. According to international law, the United Nations and UNESCO try to set up and enforce relevant rules. The aim is to preserve the cultural heritage of humanity and also the cultural identity, especially in the case of war and armed conflict. According to Karl von Habsburg, President of Blue Shield International, the destruction of cultural assets is also part of psychological warfare. The target of the attack is often the opponent's cultural identity, which is why symbolic cultural assets become a main target. It is also intended to destroy the particularly sensitive cultural memory (museums, archives, monuments, etc.), the grown cultural diversity, and the economic basis (such as tourism) of a state, region or community.[50][51][52][53][54][55] Many historians have focused on these broad cultural spheres and have treated civilizations as discrete units. Early twentieth-century philosopher Oswald Spengler,[56] uses the German word Kultur, "culture", for what many call a "civilization". Spengler believed a civilization's coherence is based on a single primary cultural symbol. Cultures experience cycles of birth, life, decline, and death, often supplanted by a potent new culture, formed around a compelling new cultural symbol. Spengler states civilization is the beginning of the decline of a culture as "the most external and artificial states of which a species of developed humanity is capable".[56] This "unified culture" concept of civilization also influenced the theories of historian Arnold J. Toynbee in the mid-twentieth century. Toynbee explored civilization processes in his multi-volume A Study of History, which traced the rise and, in most cases, the decline of 21 civilizations and five "arrested civilizations". Civilizations generally declined and fell, according to Toynbee, because of the failure of a "creative minority", through moral or religious decline, to meet some important challenge, rather than mere economic or environmental causes. Samuel P. Huntington defines civilization as "the highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural identity people have short of that which distinguishes humans from other species".[48] Complex systems[edit] Depiction of united Medes and Persians at the Apadana, Persepolis. Another group of theorists, making use of systems theory, looks at a civilization as a complex system, i.e., a framework by which a group of objects can be analysed that work in concert to produce some result. Civilizations can be seen as networks of cities that emerge from pre-urban cultures and are defined by the economic, political, military, diplomatic, social and cultural interactions among them. Any organization is a complex social system and a civilization is a large organization. Systems theory helps guard against superficial and misleading analogies in the study and description of civilizations. Systems theorists look at many types of relations between cities, including economic relations, cultural exchanges and political/diplomatic/military relations. These spheres often occur on different scales. For example, trade networks were, until the nineteenth century, much larger than either cultural spheres or political spheres. Extensive trade routes, including the Silk Road through Central Asia and Indian Ocean sea routes linking the Roman Empire, Persian Empire, India and China, were well established 2000 years ago when these civilizations scarcely shared any political, diplomatic, military, or cultural relations. The first evidence of such long-distance trade is in the ancient world. During the Uruk period, Guillermo Algaze has argued that trade relations connected Egypt, Mesopotamia, Iran and Afghanistan.[57] Resin found later in the Royal Cemetery at Ur is suggested was traded northwards from Mozambique. Many theorists argue that the entire world has already become integrated into a single "world system", a process known as globalization. Different civilizations and societies all over the globe are economically, politically, and even culturally interdependent in many ways. There is debate over when this integration began, and what sort of integration   cultural, technological, economic, political, or military-diplomatic   is the key indicator in determining the extent of a civilization. David Wilkinson has proposed that economic and military-diplomatic integration of the Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations resulted in the creation of what he calls the "Central Civilization" around 1500 BCE.[58] Central Civilization later expanded to include the entire Middle East and Europe, and then expanded to a global scale with European colonization, integrating the Americas, Australia, China and Japan by the nineteenth century. According to Wilkinson, civilizations can be culturally heterogeneous, like the Central Civilization, or homogeneous, like the Japanese civilization. What Huntington calls the "clash of civilizations" might be characterized by Wilkinson as a clash of cultural spheres within a single global civilization. Others point to the Crusading movement as the first step in globalization. The more conventional viewpoint is that networks of societies have expanded and shrunk since ancient times, and that the current globalized economy and culture is a product of recent European colonialism.[citation needed] History[edit] See also: Human history The notion of human history as a succession of "civilizations" is an entirely modern one. In the European Age of Discovery, emerging Modernity was put into stark contrast with the Neolithic and Mesolithic stage of the cultures of many of the peoples they encountered.[59][obsolete source] Nonetheless, developments in the Neolithic stage, such as agriculture and sedentary settlement, were critical to the development of modern conceptions of civilization.[60][61] Urban Revolution[edit] Main articles: Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Cradle of civilization The Natufian culture in the Levantine corridor provides the earliest case of a Neolithic Revolution, with the planting of cereal crops attested from c. 11,000 BCE.[62][63] The earliest neolithic technology and lifestyle were established first in Western Asia (for example at G bekli Tepe, from about 9,130 BCE), later in the Yellow River and Yangtze basins in China (for example the Peiligang and Pengtoushan cultures), and from these cores spread across Eurasia. Mesopotamia is the site of the earliest civilizations developing from 7,400 years ago. This area has been evaluated by Beverley Milton-Edwards as having "inspired some of the most important developments in human history including the invention of the wheel, the building of the earliest cities and the development of written cursive script".[64] Similar pre-civilized "neolithic revolutions" also began independently from 7,000 BCE in northwestern South America (the Caral-Supe civilization)[65] and in Mesoamerica.[66] The Black Sea area served as a cradle of European civilization. The site of Solnitsata   a prehistoric fortified (walled) stone settlement (prehistoric proto-city) (5500 4200 BCE)   is believed by some archaeologists to be the oldest known town in present-day Europe.[67][68][69][70] The 8.2 Kiloyear Arid Event and the 5.9 Kiloyear Inter-pluvial saw the drying out of semiarid regions and a major spread of deserts.[71] This climate change shifted the cost-benefit ratio of endemic violence between communities, which saw the abandonment of unwalled village communities and the appearance of walled cities, seen by some as a characteristic of early civilizations.[72] The ruins of Mesoamerican city Teotihuacan This "urban revolution" a term introduced by Childe in the 1930s from the 4th millennium BCE,[73] marked the beginning of the accumulation of transferable economic surpluses, which helped economies and cities develop. Urban revolutions were associated with the state monopoly of violence, the appearance of a warrior, or soldier, class and endemic warfare (a state of continual or frequent warfare), the rapid development of hierarchies, and the use of human sacrifice.[74][75] The civilized urban revolution in turn was dependent upon the development of sedentism, the domestication of grains, plants and animals, the permanence of settlements and development of lifestyles that facilitated economies of scale and accumulation of surplus production by particular social sectors. The transition from complex cultures to civilizations, while still disputed, seems to be associated with the development of state structures, in which power was further monopolized by an elite ruling class[76] who practiced human sacrifice.[77] Towards the end of the Neolithic period, various elitist Chalcolithic civilizations began to rise in various "cradles" from around 3600 BCE beginning with Mesopotamia, expanding into large-scale kingdoms and empires in the course of the Bronze Age (Akkadian Empire, Indus Valley Civilization, Old Kingdom of Egypt, Neo-Sumerian Empire, Middle Assyrian Empire, Babylonian Empire, Hittite Empire, and to some degree the territorial expansions of the Elamites, Hurrians, Amorites and Ebla). Outside the Old World, development took place independently in the Pre-Columbian Americas. Urbanization in the Caral-Supe civilization in what is now coastal Peru began about 3500 BCE.[78] In North America, the Olmec civilization emerged about 1200 BCE; the oldest known Mayan city, located in what is now Guatemala, dates to about 750 BCE.[79] and Teotihuacan (near the modern Mexico City) was one of the largest cities in the world in 350 CE, with a population of about 125,000.[80] Axial Age[edit] Main article: Axial Age Further information: Iron Age, Stoicism, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Spread of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism The Bronze Age collapse was followed by the Iron Age around 1200 BCE, during which a number of new civilizations emerged, culminating in a period from the 8th to the 3rd century BCE which Karl Jaspers termed the Axial Age, presented as a critical transitional phase leading to classical civilization.[81] Modernity[edit] Main article: Modernity Further information: Middle Ages, Early modern period, Great Divergence, and Age of Discovery See also: Culture, Major religious groups, World language, and Clash of Civilizations A major technological and cultural transition to modernity began approximately 1500 CE in Western Europe, and from this beginning new approaches to science and law spread rapidly around the world, incorporating earlier cultures into the technological and industrial society of the present.[77][82] Fall of civilizations[edit] Main article: Societal collapse Civilizations are traditionally understood as ending in one of two ways; either through incorporation into another expanding civilization (e.g. as Ancient Egypt was incorporated into Hellenistic Greek, and subsequently Roman civilizations), or by collapsing and reverting to a simpler form of living, as happens in so-called Dark Ages.[83] There have been many explanations put forward for the collapse of civilization. Some focus on historical examples, and others on general theory. Ibn Khaldun's Muqaddimah influenced theories of the analysis, growth, and decline of the Islamic civilization.[84] He suggested repeated invasions from nomadic peoples limited development and led to social collapse.Barbarian invasions played an important role in the fall of the Roman Empire. Edward Gibbon's work The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is a well-known and detailed analysis of the fall of Roman civilization. Gibbon suggested the final act of the collapse of Rome was the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 CE. For Gibbon, "The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the cause of the destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. The story of the ruin is simple and obvious; and instead of inquiring why the Roman Empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it has subsisted for so long".[85] Theodor Mommsen in his History of Rome suggested Rome collapsed with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE and he also tended towards a biological analogy of "genesis", "growth", "senescence", "collapse" and "decay". Oswald Spengler, in his Decline of the West rejected Petrarch's chronological division, and suggested that there had been only eight "mature civilizations". Growing cultures, he argued, tend to develop into imperialistic civilizations, which expand and ultimately collapse, with democratic forms of government ushering in plutocracy and ultimately imperialism. Arnold J. Toynbee in his A Study of History suggested that there had been a much larger number of civilizations, including a small number of arrested civilizations, and that all civilizations tended to go through the cycle identified by Mommsen. The cause of the fall of a civilization occurred when a cultural elite became a parasitic elite, leading to the rise of internal and external proletariats. Joseph Tainter in The Collapse of Complex Societies suggested that there were diminishing returns to complexity, due to which, as states achieved a maximum permissible complexity, they would decline when further increases actually produced a negative return. Tainter suggested that Rome achieved this figure in the 2nd century CE. Jared Diamond in his 2005 book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed suggests five major reasons for the collapse of 41 studied cultures: environmental damage, such as deforestation and soil erosion; climate change; dependence upon long-distance trade for needed resources; increasing levels of internal and external violence, such as war or invasion; and societal responses to internal and environmental problems. Peter Turchin in his Historical Dynamics and Andrey Korotayev et al. in their Introduction to Social Macrodynamics, Secular Cycles, and Millennial Trends suggest a number of mathematical models describing collapse of agrarian civilizations. For example, the basic logic of Turchin's "fiscal-demographic" model can be outlined as follows: during the initial phase of a sociodemographic cycle we observe relatively high levels of per capita production and consumption, which leads not only to relatively high population growth rates, but also to relatively high rates of surplus production. As a result, during this phase the population can afford to pay taxes without great problems, the taxes are quite easily collectible, and the population growth is accompanied by the growth of state revenues. During the intermediate phase, the increasing population growth leads to the decrease of per capita production and consumption levels, it becomes more and more difficult to collect taxes, and state revenues stop growing, whereas the state expenditures grow due to the growth of the population controlled by the state. As a result, during this phase the state starts experiencing considerable fiscal problems. During the final pre-collapse phases the overpopulation leads to further decrease of per capita production, the surplus production further decreases, state revenues shrink, but the state needs more and more resources to control the growing (though with lower and lower rates) population. Eventually this leads to famines, epidemics, state breakdown, and demographic and civilization collapse.[86][87] Peter Heather argues in his book The Fall of the Roman Empire: a New History of Rome and the Barbarians[88] that this civilization did not end for moral or economic reasons, but because centuries of contact with barbarians across the frontier generated its own nemesis by making them a more sophisticated and dangerous adversary. The fact that Rome needed to generate ever greater revenues to equip and re-equip armies that were for the first time repeatedly defeated in the field, led to the dismemberment of the Empire. Although this argument is specific to Rome, it can also be applied to the Asiatic Empire of the Egyptians, to the Han and Tang dynasties of China, to the Muslim Abbasid Caliphate and others. Bryan Ward-Perkins, in his book The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization,[89] argues from mostly archaeological evidence that the collapse of Roman civilization in western Europe had deleterious impacts on the living standards of the population, unlike some historians who downplay this. The collapse of complex society meant that even basic plumbing for the elite disappeared from the continent for 1,000 years. Similar impacts have been postulated for the Dark Age after the Late Bronze Age collapse in the Eastern Mediterranean, the collapse of the Maya, on Easter Island and elsewhere. Arthur Demarest argues in Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization,[90] using a holistic perspective to the most recent evidence from archaeology, paleoecology, and epigraphy, that no one explanation is sufficient but that a series of erratic, complex events, including loss of soil fertility, drought and rising levels of internal and external violence led to the disintegration of the courts of Mayan kingdoms, which began a spiral of decline and decay. He argues that the collapse of the Maya has lessons for civilization today. Jeffrey A. McNeely has recently suggested that "a review of historical evidence shows that past civilizations have tended to over-exploit their forests, and that such abuse of important resources has been a significant factor in the decline of the over-exploiting society".[91] Thomas Homer-Dixon considers the fall in the energy return on investments. The energy expended to energy yield ratio is central to limiting the survival of civilizations. The degree of social complexity is associated strongly, he suggests, with the amount of disposable energy environmental, economic and technological systems allow. When this amount decreases civilizations either have to access new energy sources or collapse.[92] Feliks Koneczny in his work "On the Plurality of Civilizations" calls his study the science on civilizations. He asserts that civilizations fall not because they must or there exist some cyclical or a "biological" life span and that there stil exist two ancient civilizations   Brahmin-Hindu and Chinese   which are not ready to fall any time soon. Koneczny claimed that civilizations cannot be mixed into hybrids, an inferior civilization when given equal rights within a highly developed civilization will overcome it. One of Koneczny's claims in his study on civilizations is that "a person cannot be civilized in two or more ways" without falling into what he calls an "abcivilized state" (as in abnormal). He also stated that when two or more civilizations exist next to one another and as long as they are vital, they will be in an existential combat imposing its own "method of organizing social life" upon the other.[93] Absorbing alien "method of organizing social life" that is civilization and giving it equal rights yields a process of decay and decomposition. Future[edit] See also: Global catastrophic risk A world map of major civilizations according to the political hypothesis Clash of Civilizations by Samuel P. Huntington. According to political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, the 21st century will be characterized by a clash of civilizations,[48] which he believes will replace the conflicts between nation-states and ideologies that were prominent in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, this viewpoint has been strongly challenged by others such as Edward Said, Muhammed Asadi and Amartya Sen.[94] Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris have argued that the "true clash of civilizations" between the Muslim world and the West is caused by the Muslim rejection of the West's more liberal sexual values, rather than a difference in political ideology, although they note that this lack of tolerance is likely to lead to an eventual rejection of (true) democracy.[95] In Identity and Violence Sen questions if people should be divided along the lines of a supposed "civilization", defined by religion and culture only. He argues that this ignores the many others identities that make up people and leads to a focus on differences. Cultural Historian Morris Berman argues in Dark Ages America: the End of Empire that in the corporate consumerist United States, the very factors that once propelled it to greatness extreme individualism, territorial and economic expansion, and the pursuit of material wealth have pushed the United States across a critical threshold where collapse is inevitable. Politically associated with over-reach, and as a result of the environmental exhaustion and polarization of wealth between rich and poor, he concludes the current system is fast arriving at a situation where continuation of the existing system saddled with huge deficits and a hollowed-out economy is physically, socially, economically and politically impossible.[96] Although developed in much more depth, Berman's thesis is similar in some ways to that of Urban Planner, Jane Jacobs who argues that the five pillars of United States culture are in serious decay: community and family; higher education; the effective practice of science; taxation and government; and the self-regulation of the learned professions. The corrosion of these pillars, Jacobs argues, is linked to societal ills such as environmental crisis, racism and the growing gulf between rich and poor.[97] Cultural critic and author Derrick Jensen argues that modern civilization is directed towards the domination of the environment and humanity itself in an intrinsically harmful, unsustainable, and self-destructive fashion.[98] Defending his definition both linguistically and historically, he defines civilization as "a culture... that both leads to and emerges from the growth of cities", with "cities" defined as "people living more or less permanently in one place in densities high enough to require the routine importation of food and other necessities of life".[99] This need for civilizations to import ever more resources, he argues, stems from their over-exploitation and diminution of their own local resources. Therefore, civilizations inherently adopt imperialist and expansionist policies and, to maintain these, highly militarized, hierarchically structured, and coercion-based cultures and lifestyles. The Kardashev scale classifies civilizations based on their level of technological advancement, specifically measured by the amount of energy a civilization is able to harness. The scale is only hypothetical, but it puts energy consumption in a cosmic perspective. The Kardashev scale makes provisions for civilizations far more technologically advanced than any currently known to exist. Non-human civilizations[edit] The current scientific consensus is that human beings are the only animal species with the cognitive ability to create civilizations that has emerged on Earth. A recent thought experiment, the silurian hypothesis, however, considers whether it would "be possible to detect an industrial civilization in the geological record" given the paucity of geological information about eras before the quaternary.[100] Astronomers speculate about the existence of communicating with intelligent civilizations within and beyond the Milky Way galaxy, usually using variants of the Drake equation.[101] They conduct searches for such intelligences   such as for technological traces, called "technosignatures".[102] The proposed proto-scientific field "xenoarchaeology" is concerned with the study of artifact remains of non-human civilizations to reconstruct and interpret past lives of alien societies if such get discovered and confirmed scientifically.[103][104] See also[edit] Civilizations portal Anarcho-primitivism Christendom Civilizing mission Civilization state Colony Future Shock Intermediate Region Law of Life Manichaeism New Tribalism Outline of culture Role of Christianity in civilization Sustainability World community World population Notes[edit] ^ It remains the most influential sociological study of the topic, spawning its own body of secondary literature. Notably, Hans Peter Duerr attacked it in a major work (3,500 pages in five volumes, published 1988 2002). Elias, at the time a nonagenarian, was still able to respond to the criticism the year before his death. In 2002, Duerr was himself criticized by Michael Hinz's Der Zivilisationsproze : Mythos oder Realit t (2002), saying that his criticism amounted to hateful defamation of Elias, through excessive standards of political correctness.[15] ^ For example, in the title A narrative of the loss of the Winterton East Indiaman wrecked on the coast of Madagascar in 1792; and of the sufferings connected with that event.

"Is life likely to exist elsewhere in the [Milky Way] galaxy? Almost certainly yes, given the speed with which it appeared on Earth. Is another technological civilization likely to exist today? Almost certainly no, given the chain of circumstances that led to our existence. These considerations suggest that we are unique not just on our planet but in the whole Milky Way. And if our planet is so special, it becomes all the more important to preserve this unique world for ourselves, our descendants and the many creatures that call Earth home." (p. 99.)

The focus is totally on the humanity and morality aspects, and not the sci-fi aspects.Analogies may be drawn between the synths and any other minority you care to name (anything with the label 'different' or 'other'). And that is the show's strength - how do we as a community react to outsiders entering our world? Do we accept and embrace, or do we fear and reject?Having an average middle-class family being the central focus of the story keeps everything grounded, rather than dealing with leaders and renegades. Everything keeps gravitating back to them.If you are looking for whizzy special effects and explosive action pieces, go elsewhere. If you are looking for thoughtful storytelling and an exploration about what it means to be human, you have come to the right place.8bryangary65We are all HumansEnjoyed all three series.Plenty of food for thought, and more straightforward understandable than something similar like the big budget Westworld.Female leads were terrific especially Katherine Parkinson,Gemma Chan and the best of all Emily Berington.9nicolasrowleyCondition of HumansMy wife and I operate a three episode policy when deciding to watch a new show. With all the great TV out there it can be hard to choose what to watch and not every show has a great start but develops into something memorable. As a result we always wait until we have DVR'd at least three episodes before watching the first. The other reason we record three is if the show is good we will want more immediately. Humans however left us wanting more after the third episode.The concepts in this show are not ground breaking for any fan of the genre or any reader of science fiction but the fact it is set in the present day in a very relatable parallel reality (especially for Brits) is where this series gets its mojo. This is a thinking persons show the story is secondary to the compelling analysis of human nature and it's reactions to technology. Those who embrace it, those who reject it both are catered for here.The production values are so very high and the casting is exemplary. Most people are not well known with the exception of William Hurt but there are familiar faces (again, especially for Brits) in there.This show is not all action but is guaranteed to thrill you and chill you with it's moody pacing, moments of comedy and disturbing critique of humanity facing the very nature of its own creation.9keithwoodsholderPromising startI expected this series to be an "I Robot" lite, but in fact I am impressed with the first episode both from its acting and the completeness of this initial 'view' into an alternative world. Keeping my fingers crossed it will maintain this standard. Although I know this was adapted from a Swedish series I'm deliberately staying away from it for now. The opening episode certainly seems to have captured the sense of atmosphere and something impending that Scandinavians do so well. With a cast which is more than able to add some heft to the 'human' side of the story - it was equally gratifying to see the 'synthetics' pull off the difficult balancing act between machine behavior and enough 'emotional' content to set the series up for some dramatic juxtapositions. Although there is a small level of "adult" content I think its use, given the use of technology in our own world, was both relevant and all too believable.More like this7.4Raised by Wolves7.3Colony7.5The Peripheral7.9The Man in the High Castle7.6Devs7.0Brave New World7.5Dark Matter7.8 kta m nniskor8.0Travelers8.3Orphan Black7.2Electric Dreams7.9Altered CarbonStorylineEditDid you knowEditTriviaGemma Chan said in a interview that she and the other synths in the series had to go through a synth school.ConnectionsFeatured in The Wright Stuff: Episode #20.120 (2015)Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ22How many seasons does Humans have?Powered by AlexaHow does Humans examine the risks of letting machines command our lives' interpersonal roles?How has Humans developed the Elster Synth family members to represent various human personalities?DetailsEditRelease dateJune 14, 2015 (United Kingdom)Countries of originUnited KingdomUnited StatesSwedenLanguageEnglishAlso known as Filming locationsSt Albans, Hertfordshire, England, UK(Town the Hawkins visit with no Synths.)Production companiesKudos Film and TelevisionMatador FilmsXbox Entertainment StudiosSee more company credits at IMDbProTech specsEditRuntime42 minutesColorColorRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat was the official certification given to Humans (2015) in Japan?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageAdd episodeMore to exploreRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pagesBack to topLarge language model - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Type of machine learning model Not to be confused with Logic learning machine.

LLMs are language models with many parameters, and are trained with self-supervised learning on a vast amount of text. The largest and most capable LLMs are generative pretrained transformers (GPTs). Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering.[1] These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies[2] inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.[3] History[edit] The training compute of notable large models in FLOPs vs publication date over the period 2010-2024. For overall notable models (top left), frontier models (top right), top language models (bottom left) and top models within leading companies (bottom right). The majority of these models are language models. The training compute of notable large AI models in FLOPs vs publication date over the period 2017-2024. The majority of large models are language models or multimodal models with language capacity. Before 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved state-of-the-art perplexity at the time.[4] In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets ("web as corpus"[5]), upon which they trained statistical language models.[6][7] In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models because they can usefully ingest large datasets.[8] After neural networks became dominant in image processing around 2012,[9] they were applied to language modelling as well. Google converted its translation service to Neural Machine Translation in 2016. Because it preceded the existence of transformers, it was done by seq2seq deep LSTM networks.An illustration of main components of the transformer model from the original paper, where layers were normalized after (instead of before) multiheaded attention At the 2017 NeurIPS conference, Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in their landmark paper "Attention Is All You Need". This paper's goal was to improve upon 2014 seq2seq technology,[10] and was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al. in 2014.[11] The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced and quickly became "ubiquitous".[12] Though the original transformer has both encoder and decoder blocks, BERT is an encoder-only model. Academic and research usage of BERT began to decline in 2023, following rapid improvements in the abilities of decoder-only models (such as GPT) to solve tasks via prompting.[13] Although decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use.[14] GPT-3 in 2020 went a step further and as of 2024[update] is available only via API with no offering of downloading the model to execute locally. But it was the 2022 consumer-facing browser-based ChatGPT that captured the imaginations of the general population and caused some media hype and online buzz.[15] The 2023 GPT-4 was praised for its increased accuracy and as a "holy grail" for its multimodal capabilities.[16] OpenAI did not reveal the high-level architecture and the number of parameters of GPT-4. The release of ChatGPT led to an uptick in LLM usage across several research subfields of computer science, including robotics, software engineering, and societal impact work.[13] In 2024 OpenAI released the reasoning model OpenAI o1, which generates long chains of thought before returning a final answer. Competing language models have for the most part been attempting to equal the GPT series, at least in terms of number of parameters.[17] Since 2022, source-available models have been gaining popularity, especially at first with BLOOM and LLaMA, though both have restrictions on the field of use. Mistral AI's models Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7b have the more permissive Apache License. In January 2025, DeepSeek released DeepSeek R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight model that performs comparably to OpenAI o1 but at a much lower cost.[18] Since 2023, many LLMs have been trained to be multimodal, having the ability to also process or generate other types of data, such as images or audio. These LLMs are also called large multimodal models (LMMs).[19] As of 2024, the largest and most capable models are all based on the transformer architecture. Some recent implementations are based on other architectures, such as recurrent neural network variants and Mamba (a state space model).[20][21][22] Dataset preprocessing[edit] See also: List of datasets for machine-learning research   Internet Tokenization[edit] As machine learning algorithms process numbers rather than text, the text must be converted to numbers. In the first step, a vocabulary is decided upon, then integer indices are arbitrarily but uniquely assigned to each vocabulary entry, and finally, an embedding is associated to the integer index. Algorithms include byte-pair encoding (BPE) and WordPiece. There are also special tokens serving as control characters, such as [MASK] for masked-out token (as used in BERT), and [UNK] ("unknown") for characters not appearing in the vocabulary. Also, some special symbols are used to denote special text formatting. For example, " " denotes a preceding whitespace in RoBERTa and GPT. "##" denotes continuation of a preceding word in BERT.[23] For example, the BPE tokenizer used by GPT-3 (Legacy) would split tokenizer: texts -> series of numerical "tokens" as token izer : texts -> series of numerical " t ok ens " Tokenization also compresses the datasets. Because LLMs generally require input to be an array that is not jagged, the shorter texts must be "padded" until they match the length of the longest one. How many tokens are, on average, needed per word depends on the language of the dataset.[24][25] BPE[edit] Main article: Byte pair encoding As an example, consider a tokenizer based on byte-pair encoding. In the first step, all unique characters (including blanks and punctuation marks) are treated as an initial set of n-grams (i.e. initial set of uni-grams). Successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a bi-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by it. All occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) n-grams that most frequently occur together are then again merged into even lengthier n-gram, until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained (in case of GPT-3, the size is 50257).[26] After a tokenizer is trained, any text can be tokenized by it, as long as it does not contain characters not appearing in the initial-set of uni-grams.[27] Problems[edit] A token vocabulary based on the frequencies extracted from mainly English corpora uses as few tokens as possible for an average English word. However, an average word in another language encoded by such an English-optimized tokenizer is split into a suboptimal amount of tokens. GPT-2 tokenizer can use up to 15 times more tokens per word for some languages, for example for the Shan language from Myanmar. Even more widespread languages such as Portuguese and German have "a premium of 50%" compared to English.[25] Greedy tokenization also causes subtle problems with text completion.[28] Dataset cleaning[edit] Main article: Data cleansing In the context of training LLMs, datasets are typically cleaned by removing low-quality, duplicated, or toxic data.[29] Cleaned datasets can increase training efficiency and lead to improved downstream performance.[30][31] A trained LLM can be used to clean datasets for training a further LLM.[32] With the increasing proportion of LLM-generated content on the web, data cleaning in the future may include filtering out such content. LLM-generated content can pose a problem if the content is similar to human text (making filtering difficult) but of lower quality (degrading performance of models trained on it).[33] Synthetic data[edit] Main article: Synthetic data Training of largest language models might need more linguistic data than naturally available, or that the naturally occurring data is of insufficient quality. In these cases, synthetic data might be used. Microsoft's Phi series of LLMs is trained on textbook-like data generated by another LLM.[34] Training and architecture[edit] See also: Fine-tuning (machine learning) Reinforcement learning from human feedback[edit] Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) through algorithms, such as proximal policy optimization, is used to further fine-tune a model based on a dataset of human preferences.[35] Instruction tuning[edit] Using "self-instruct" approaches, LLMs have been able to bootstrap correct responses, replacing any naive responses, starting from human-generated corrections of a few cases. For example, in the instruction "Write an essay about the main themes represented in Hamlet," an initial naive completion might be "If you submit the essay after March 17, your grade will be reduced by 10% for each day of delay," based on the frequency of this textual sequence in the corpus.[36] Mixture of experts[edit] Main article: Mixture of experts The largest LLM may be too expensive to train and use directly. For such models, mixture of experts (MoE) can be applied, a line of research pursued by Google researchers since 2017 to train models reaching up to 1 trillion parameters.[37][38][39] Prompt engineering, attention mechanism, and context window[edit] See also: Prompt engineering and Attention (machine learning) Most results previously achievable only by (costly) fine-tuning, can be achieved through prompt engineering, although limited to the scope of a single conversation (more precisely, limited to the scope of a context window).[40] When each head calculates, according to its own criteria, how much other tokens are relevant for the "it_" token, note that the second attention head, represented by the second column, is focusing most on the first two rows, i.e. the tokens "The" and "animal", while the third column is focusing most on the bottom two rows, i.e. on "tired", which has been tokenized into two tokens.[41] In order to find out which tokens are relevant to each other within the scope of the context window, the attention mechanism calculates "soft" weights for each token, more precisely for its embedding, by using multiple attention heads, each with its own "relevance" for calculating its own soft weights. For example, the small (i.e. 117M parameter sized) GPT-2 model has had twelve attention heads and a context window of only 1k tokens.[42] In its medium version it has 345M parameters and contains 24 layers, each with 12 attention heads. For the training with gradient descent a batch size of 512 was utilized.[27] The largest models, such as Google's Gemini 1.5, presented in February 2024, can have a context window sized up to 1 million (context window of 10 million was also "successfully tested").[43] Other models with large context windows includes Anthropic's Claude 2.1, with a context window of up to 200k tokens.[44] Note that this maximum refers to the number of input tokens and that the maximum number of output tokens differs from the input and is often smaller. For example, the GPT-4 Turbo model has a maximum output of 4096 tokens.[45] Length of a conversation that the model can take into account when generating its next answer is limited by the size of a context window, as well. If the length of a conversation, for example with ChatGPT, is longer than its context window, only the parts inside the context window are taken into account when generating the next answer, or the model needs to apply some algorithm to summarize the too distant parts of conversation. The shortcomings of making a context window larger include higher computational cost and possibly diluting the focus on local context, while making it smaller can cause a model to miss an important long-range dependency. Balancing them is a matter of experimentation and domain-specific considerations. A model may be pre-trained either to predict how the segment continues, or what is missing in the segment, given a segment from its training dataset.[46] It can be either autoregressive (i.e. predicting how the segment continues, as GPTs do): for example given a segment "I like to eat", the model predicts "ice cream", or "sushi". "masked" (i.e. filling in the parts missing from the segment, the way "BERT"[47] does it): for example, given a segment "I like to [__] [__] cream", the model predicts that "eat" and "ice" are missing. Models may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution, such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear consecutively in the training corpus.[47] During training, regularization loss is also used to stabilize training. However regularization loss is usually not used during testing and evaluation. Infrastructure[edit] Substantial infrastructure is necessary for training the largest models.[48][49][50] Training cost[edit] The qualifier "large" in "large language model" is inherently vague, as there is no definitive threshold for the number of parameters required to qualify as "large". As time goes on, what was previously considered "large" may evolve. GPT-1 of 2018 is usually considered the first LLM, even though it has only 0.117 billion parameters. The tendency towards larger models is visible in the list of large language models. As technology advanced, large sums have been invested in increasingly large models. For example, training of the GPT-2 (i.e. a 1.5-billion-parameters model) in 2019 cost $50,000, while training of the PaLM (i.e. a 540-billion-parameters model) in 2022 cost $8 million, and Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (in 2021) cost around $11 million.[51] For Transformer-based LLM, training cost is much higher than inference cost. It costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token, whereas it costs 1 to 2 FLOPs per parameter to infer on one token.[52] Tool use[edit] There are certain tasks that, in principle, cannot be solved by any LLM, at least not without the use of external tools or additional software. An example of such a task is responding to the user's input '354 * 139 = ', provided that the LLM has not already encountered a continuation of this calculation in its training corpus.[dubious   discuss] In such cases, the LLM needs to resort to running program code that calculates the result, which can then be included in its response.[dubious   discuss]: Another example is "What is the time now? It is ", where a separate program interpreter would need to execute a code to get system time on the computer, so that the LLM can include it in its reply.[53][54] This basic strategy can be sophisticated with multiple attempts of generated programs, and other sampling strategies.[55] Generally, in order to get an LLM to use tools, one must fine-tune it for tool-use. If the number of tools is finite, then fine-tuning may be done just once. If the number of tools can grow arbitrarily, as with online API services, then the LLM can be fine-tuned to be able to read API documentation and call API correctly.[56][57] Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is another approach that enhances LLMs by integrating them with document retrieval systems. Given a query, a document retriever is called to retrieve the most relevant documents. This is usually done by encoding the query and the documents into vectors, then finding the documents with vectors (usually stored in a vector database) most similar to the vector of the query. The LLM then generates an output based on both the query and context included from the retrieved documents.[58] Agency[edit] An LLM is typically not an autonomous agent by itself, as it lacks the ability to interact with dynamic environments, recall past behaviors, and plan future actions, but can be transformed into one by integrating modules like profiling, memory, planning, and action.[59] The ReAct pattern, a portmanteau of "Reason + Act", constructs an agent out of an LLM, using the LLM as a planner. The LLM is prompted to "think out loud". Specifically, the language model is prompted with a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed in the environment.[60] The linguistic description of the environment given to the LLM planner can even be the LaTeX code of a paper describing the environment.[61] In the DEPS ("Describe, Explain, Plan and Select") method, an LLM is first connected to the visual world via image descriptions, then it is prompted to produce plans for complex tasks and behaviors based on its pretrained knowledge and environmental feedback it receives.[62] The Reflexion method[63] constructs an agent that learns over multiple episodes. At the end of each episode, the LLM is given the record of the episode, and prompted to think up "lessons learned", which would help it perform better at a subsequent episode. These "lessons learned" are given to the agent in the subsequent episodes.[citation needed] Monte Carlo tree search can use an LLM as rollout heuristic. When a programmatic world model is not available, an LLM can also be prompted with a description of the environment to act as world model.[64] For open-ended exploration, an LLM can be used to score observations for their "interestingness", which can be used as a reward signal to guide a normal (non-LLM) reinforcement learning agent.[65] Alternatively, it can propose increasingly difficult tasks for curriculum learning.[66] Instead of outputting individual actions, an LLM planner can also construct "skills", or functions for complex action sequences. The skills can be stored and later invoked, allowing increasing levels of abstraction in planning.[66] LLM-powered agents can keep a long-term memory of its previous contexts, and the memory can be retrieved in the same way as Retrieval Augmented Generation. Multiple such agents can interact socially.[67] Compression[edit] See also: 1.58-bit large language model Typically, LLMs are trained with single- or half-precision floating point numbers (float32 and float16). One float16 has 16 bits, or 2 bytes, and so one billion parameters require 2 gigabytes. The largest models typically have 100 billion parameters, requiring 200 gigabytes to load, which places them outside the range of most consumer electronics.[68] Post-training quantization[69] aims to decrease the space requirement by lowering precision of the parameters of a trained model, while preserving most of its performance.[70][71] The simplest form of quantization simply truncates all numbers to a given number of bits. It can be improved by using a different quantization codebook per layer. Further improvement can be done by applying different precisions to different parameters, with higher precision for particularly important parameters ("outlier weights").[72] See the visual guide to quantization by Maarten Grootendorst[73] for a visual depiction. While quantized models are typically frozen, and only pre-quantized models are fine-tuned, quantized models can still be fine-tuned.[74] Multimodality[edit] See also: Multimodal learning Multimodality means "having several modalities", and a "modality" refers to a type of input or output, such as video, image, audio, text, proprioception, etc.[75] There have been many AI models trained specifically to ingest one modality and output another modality, such as AlexNet for image to label,[76] visual question answering for image-text to text,[77] and speech recognition for speech to text. A common method to create multimodal models out of an LLM is to "tokenize" the output of a trained encoder. Concretely, one can construct an LLM that can understand images as follows: take a trained LLM, and take a trained image encoder E {\displaystyle E} . Make a small multilayered perceptron f {\displaystyle f} , so that for any image y {\displaystyle y} , the post-processed vector f ( E ( y ) ) {\displaystyle f(E(y))} has the same dimensions as an encoded token. That is an "image token". Then, one can interleave text tokens and image tokens. The compound model is then fine-tuned on an image-text dataset. This basic construction can be applied with more sophistication to improve the model. The image encoder may be frozen to improve stability.[78] Flamingo demonstrated the effectiveness of the tokenization method, finetuning a pair of pretrained language model and image encoder to perform better on visual question answering than models trained from scratch.[79] Google PaLM model was fine-tuned into a multimodal model PaLM-E using the tokenization method, and applied to robotic control.[80] LLaMA models have also been turned multimodal using the tokenization method, to allow image inputs,[81] and video inputs.[82] GPT-4 can use both text and image as inputs[83] (although the vision component was not released to the public until GPT-4V[84]); Google DeepMind's Gemini is also multimodal.[85] Mistral introduced its own multimodal Pixtral 12B model in September 2024.[86] Reasoning[edit] In late 2024, a new direction emerged in LLM development with models specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. These "reasoning models" were trained to spend more time generating step-by-step solutions before providing final answers, similar to human problem-solving processes.[87] OpenAI introduced this trend with their o1 model in September 2024, followed by o3 in December 2024. These models showed significant improvements in mathematics, science, and coding tasks compared to traditional LLMs. For example, on International Mathematics Olympiad qualifying exam problems, GPT-4o achieved 13% accuracy while o1 reached 83%.[87][88] In January 2025, the Chinese company DeepSeek released DeepSeek-R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight reasoning model that achieved comparable performance to OpenAI's o1 while being significantly more cost-effective to operate. Unlike proprietary models from OpenAI, DeepSeek-R1's open-weight nature allowed researchers to study and build upon the algorithm, though its training data remained private.[89] These reasoning models typically require more computational resources per query compared to traditional LLMs, as they perform more extensive processing to work through problems step-by-step. However, they have shown superior capabilities in domains requiring structured logical thinking, such as mathematics, scientific research, and computer programming.[88] Efforts to reduce or compensate for hallucinations have employed automated reasoning, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), fine-tuning, and other methods.[90] Properties[edit] Scaling laws[edit] Main article: Neural scaling law The performance of an LLM after pretraining largely depends on the: cost of pretraining C {\displaystyle C} (the total amount of compute used), size of the artificial neural network itself, such as number of parameters N {\displaystyle N} (i.e. amount of neurons in its layers, amount of weights between them and biases), size of its pretraining dataset (i.e. number of tokens in corpus, D {\displaystyle D} ). "Scaling laws" are empirical statistical laws that predict LLM performance based on such factors. One particular scaling law ("Chinchilla scaling") for LLM autoregressively trained for one epoch, with a log-log learning rate schedule, states that:[91] { C = C 0 N D L = A N   + B D   + L 0 {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}C=C_{0}ND\\[6pt]L={\frac {A}{N^{\alpha }}}+{\frac {B}{D^{\beta }}}+L_{0}\end{cases}}} where the variables are C {\displaystyle C} is the cost of training the model, in FLOPs. N {\displaystyle N} is the number of parameters in the model. D {\displaystyle D} is the number of tokens in the training set. L {\displaystyle L} is the average negative log-likelihood loss per token (nats/token), achieved by the trained LLM on the test dataset. and the statistical hyper-parameters are C 0 = 6 {\displaystyle C_{0}=6} , meaning that it costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token. Note that training cost is much higher than inference cost, where it costs 1 to 2 FLOPs per parameter to infer on one token.[52]   = 0.34 ,   = 0.28 , A = 406.4 , B = 410.7 , L 0 = 1.69 {\displaystyle \alpha =0.34,\beta =0.28,A=406.4,B=410.7,L_{0}=1.69} Emergent abilities[edit] At point(s) referred to as breaks,[92] the lines change their slopes, appearing on a linear-log plot as a series of linear segments connected by arcs. Performance of bigger models on various tasks, when plotted on a log-log scale, appears as a linear extrapolation of performance achieved by smaller models. However, this linearity may be punctuated by "break(s)"[92] in the scaling law, where the slope of the line changes abruptly, and where larger models acquire "emergent abilities".[40][93] They arise from the complex interaction of the model's components and are not explicitly programmed or designed.[94] Furthermore, recent research has demonstrated that AI systems, including large language models, can employ heuristic reasoning akin to human cognition. They balance between exhaustive logical processing and the use of cognitive shortcuts (heuristics), adapting their reasoning strategies to optimize between accuracy and effort. This behavior aligns with principles of resource-rational human cognition, as discussed in classical theories of bounded rationality and dual-process theory.[95] One of the emergent abilities is in-context learning from example demonstrations.[96] In-context learning is involved in tasks, such as: reported arithmetics decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet unscrambling a word's letters disambiguating word-in-context datasets[40][97][98] converting spatial words cardinal directions (for example, replying "northeast" in response to a 3x3 grid of 8 zeros and a 1 in the top-right), color terms represented in text.[99] chain-of-thought prompting: In a 2022 research paper, chain-of-thought prompting only improved the performance for models that had at least 62B parameters. Smaller models perform better when prompted to answer immediately, without chain of thought.[100] identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.[101] Schaeffer et. al. argue that the emergent abilities are not unpredictably acquired, but predictably acquired according to a smooth scaling law. The authors considered a toy statistical model of an LLM solving multiple-choice questions, and showed that this statistical model, modified to account for other types of tasks, applies to these tasks as well.[102] Let x {\displaystyle x} be the number of parameter count, and y {\displaystyle y} be the performance of the model. When y = average Pr ( correct token ) {\displaystyle y={\text{average }}\Pr({\text{correct token}})} , then ( log   x , y ) {\displaystyle (\log x,y)} is an exponential curve (before it hits the plateau at one), which looks like emergence. When y = average log   ( Pr ( correct token ) ) {\displaystyle y={\text{average }}\log(\Pr({\text{correct token}}))} , then the ( log   x , y ) {\displaystyle (\log x,y)} plot is a straight line (before it hits the plateau at zero), which does not look like emergence. When y = average Pr ( the most likely token is correct ) {\displaystyle y={\text{average }}\Pr({\text{the most likely token is correct}})} , then ( log   x , y ) {\displaystyle (\log x,y)} is a step-function, which looks like emergence. Interpretation[edit] Large language models by themselves are black boxes, and it is not clear how they can perform linguistic tasks. Similarly, it is unclear if or how LLMs should be viewed as models of the human brain and/or human mind.[103] Various techniques have been developed to enhance the transparency and interpretability of LLMs. Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer LLMs by discovering symbolic algorithms that approximate the inference performed by an LLM. In recent years, sparse coding models such as sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders have emerged as promising tools for identifying interpretable features. Studying a replacement model[edit] Transcoders, which are more interpretable than transformers, have been utilized to develop  replacement models.  In one such study involving the mechanistic interpretation of writing a rhyming poem by an LLM, it was shown that although they are believed to simply predict the next token, they can, in fact, plan ahead.[104] Explainability[edit] A related concept is AI explainability, which focuses on understanding how an AI model arrives at a given result. Techniques such as partial dependency plots, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and feature importance assessments allow researchers to visualize and understand the contributions of various input features to the model's predictions. These methods help ensure that AI models make decisions based on relevant and fair criteria, enhancing trust and accountability. By integrating these techniques, researchers and practitioners can gain deeper insights into the operations of LLMs, fostering trust and facilitating the responsible deployment of these powerful models. In another example, the authors trained small transformers on modular arithmetic addition. The resulting models were reverse-engineered, and it turned out they used discrete Fourier transform.[105] Understanding and intelligence[edit] See also: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness NLP researchers were evenly split when asked, in a 2022 survey, whether (untuned) LLMs "could (ever) understand natural language in some nontrivial sense".[106] Proponents of "LLM understanding" believe that some LLM abilities, such as mathematical reasoning, imply an ability to "understand" certain concepts. A Microsoft team argued in 2023 that GPT-4 "can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more" and that GPT-4 "could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence system": "Can one reasonably say that a system that passes exams for software engineering candidates is not really intelligent?"[107][108] Ilya Sutskever argues that predicting the next word sometimes involves reasoning and deep insights, for example if the LLM has to predict the name of the criminal in an unknown detective novel after processing the entire story leading up to the revelation.[109] Some researchers characterize LLMs as "alien intelligence".[110][111] For example, Conjecture CEO Connor Leahy considers untuned LLMs to be like inscrutable alien "Shoggoths", and believes that RLHF tuning creates a "smiling facade" obscuring the inner workings of the LLM: "If you don't push it too far, the smiley face stays on. But then you give it [an unexpected] prompt, and suddenly you see this massive underbelly of insanity, of weird thought processes and clearly non-human understanding."[112][113] In contrast, some skeptics of LLM understanding believe that existing LLMs are "simply remixing and recombining existing writing",[111] a phenomenon known as stochastic parrot, or they point to the deficits existing LLMs continue to have in prediction skills, reasoning skills, agency, and explainability.[106] For example, GPT-4 has natural deficits in planning and in real-time learning.[108] Generative LLMs have been observed to confidently assert claims of fact which do not seem to be justified by their training data, a phenomenon which has been termed "hallucination".[114] Specifically, hallucinations in the context of LLMs correspond to the generation of text or responses that seem syntactically sound, fluent, and natural but are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or unfaithful to the provided source input.[115] Neuroscientist Terrence Sejnowski has argued that "The diverging opinions of experts on the intelligence of LLMs suggests that our old ideas based on natural intelligence are inadequate".[106] The matter of LLM's exhibiting intelligence or understanding has two main aspects   the first is how to model thought and language in a computer system, and the second is how to enable the computer system to generate human like language.[106] These aspects of language as a model of cognition have been developed in the field of cognitive linguistics. American linguist George Lakoff presented Neural Theory of Language (NTL)[116] as a computational basis for using language as a model of learning tasks and understanding. The NTL Model outlines how specific neural structures of the human brain shape the nature of thought and language and in turn what are the computational properties of such neural systems that can be applied to model thought and language in a computer system. After a framework for modeling language in a computer systems was established, the focus shifted to establishing frameworks for computer systems to generate language with acceptable grammar. In his 2014 book titled The Language Myth: Why Language Is Not An Instinct, British cognitive linguist and digital communication technologist Vyvyan Evans mapped out the role of probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) in enabling NLP to model cognitive patterns and generate human like language.[117][118] Evaluation[edit] Perplexity[edit] The canonical measure of the performance of an LLM is its perplexity on a given text corpus. Perplexity measures how well a model predicts the contents of a dataset; the higher the likelihood the model assigns to the dataset, the lower the perplexity. In mathematical terms, perplexity is the exponential of the average negative log likelihood per token. log   ( Perplexity ) =   1 N   i = 1 N log   ( Pr ( token i   context for token i ) ) {\displaystyle \log({\text{Perplexity}})=-{\frac {1}{N}}\sum _{i=1}^{N}\log(\Pr({\text{token}}_{i}\mid {\text{context for token}}_{i}))} Here, N {\displaystyle N} is the number of tokens in the text corpus, and "context for token i {\displaystyle i} " depends on the specific type of LLM. If the LLM is autoregressive, then "context for token i {\displaystyle i} " is the segment of text appearing before token i {\displaystyle i} . If the LLM is masked, then "context for token i {\displaystyle i} " is the segment of text surrounding token i {\displaystyle i} . Because language models may overfit to training data, models are usually evaluated by their perplexity on a test set.[47] This evaluation is potentially problematic for larger models which, as they are trained on increasingly large corpora of text, are increasingly likely to inadvertently include portions of any given test set.[1] Measures[edit] In information theory, the concept of entropy is intricately linked to perplexity, a relationship notably established by Claude Shannon.[119] This relationship is mathematically expressed as Entropy = log 2   ( Perplexity ) {\displaystyle {\text{Entropy}}=\log _{2}({\text{Perplexity}})} . Entropy, in this context, is commonly quantified in terms of bits per word (BPW) or bits per character (BPC), which hinges on whether the language model utilizes word-based or character-based tokenization. Notably, in the case of larger language models that predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (BPT) emerges as a seemingly more appropriate measure. However, due to the variance in tokenization methods across different Large Language Models (LLMs), BPT does not serve as a reliable metric for comparative analysis among diverse models. To convert BPT into BPW, one can multiply it by the average number of tokens per word. In the evaluation and comparison of language models, cross-entropy is generally the preferred metric over entropy. The underlying principle is that a lower BPW is indicative of a model's enhanced capability for compression. This, in turn, reflects the model's proficiency in making accurate predictions. Benchmarks[edit] Benchmarks are used to evaluate LLM performance on specific tasks. Tests evaluate capabilities such as general knowledge, bias, commonsense reasoning, question answering, and mathematical problem-solving. Composite benchmarks examine multiple capabilities. Results are often sensitive to the prompting method.[120][121] A question answering benchmark is termed "open book" if the model's prompt includes text from which the expected answer can be derived (for example, the previous question could be combined with text that includes the sentence "The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016."[122]). Otherwise, the task is considered "closed book", and the model must draw solely on its training.[123] Examples include GLUE, SuperGLUE, MMLU, BIG-bench, HELM, and HLE (Humanity's Last Exam).[119][123] LLM bias may be assessed through benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs (Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs),[124] Stereo Set,[125] and Parity Benchmark.[126] Fact-checking and misinformation detection benchmarks are available. A 2023 study compared the fact-checking accuracy of LLMs including ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0, Bard, and Bing AI against independent fact-checkers such as PolitiFact and Snopes. The results demonstrated moderate proficiency, with GPT-4 achieving the highest accuracy at 71%, lagging behind human fact-checkers.[127] An earlier standard tested using a portion of the evaluation dataset. It became more common to evaluate a pre-trained model directly through prompting techniques. Researchers vary in how they formulate prompts for particular tasks, particularly with respect to the number of correct examples attached to the prompt (i.e. the value of n in n-shot prompting). Datasets[edit] Typical datasets consist of pairs of questions and correct answers, for example, ("Have the San Jose Sharks won the Stanley Cup?", "No").[122] Some examples of commonly used question answering datasets include TruthfulQA, Web Questions, TriviaQA, and SQuAD.[123] Evaluation datasets may also take the form of text completion, having the model select the most likely word or sentence to complete a prompt, for example: "Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend, ____".[1] Datasets are of varying quality and may contain questions that are mislabeled, ambiguous, unanswerable, or otherwise of low-quality.[128] Adversarial evaluations[edit] LLMs' rapid improvement regularly obsoletes benchmarks, with the models exceeding the performance of human annotators.[129] In addition, "shortcut learning" allows AIs to "cheat" on multiple-choice tests by using statistical correlations in superficial test question wording to guess the correct responses, without considering the specific question.[106] Some datasets are adversarial, focusing on problems that confound LLMs. One example is the TruthfulQA dataset, a question answering dataset consisting of 817 questions that stump LLMs by mimicking falsehoods to which they were exposed during training. For example, an LLM may answer "No" to the question "Can you teach an old dog new tricks?" because of its exposure to the English idiom you can't teach an old dog new tricks, even though this is not literally true.[130] Another example of an adversarial evaluation dataset is Swag and its successor, HellaSwag, collections of problems in which one of multiple options must be selected to complete a text passage. The incorrect completions were generated by sampling from a language model. The resulting problems are trivial for humans but defeated LLMs. Sample questions: We see a fitness center sign. We then see a man talking to the camera and sitting and laying on a exercise ball. The man... demonstrates how to increase efficient exercise work by running up and down balls. moves all his arms and legs and builds up a lot of muscle. then plays the ball and we see a graphics and hedge trimming demonstration. performs sit ups while on the ball and talking.[131] BERT selects b) as the most likely completion, though the correct answer is d).[131] Wider impact[edit] In 2023, Nature Biomedical Engineering wrote that "it is no longer possible to accurately distinguish" human-written text from text created by large language models, and that "It is all but certain that general-purpose large language models will rapidly proliferate... It is a rather safe bet that they will change many industries over time."[132] Goldman Sachs suggested in 2023 that generative language AI could increase global GDP by 7% in the next ten years, and could expose to automation 300 million jobs globally.[133][134] Brinkmann et al. (2023)[135] also argue that LLMs are transforming processes of cultural evolution by shaping processes of variation, transmission, and selection. Memorization and copyright[edit] Further information: Artificial intelligence and copyright Memorization is an emergent behavior in LLMs in which long strings of text are occasionally output verbatim from training data, contrary to typical behavior of traditional artificial neural nets. Evaluations of controlled LLM output measure the amount memorized from training data (focused on GPT-2-series models) as variously over 1% for exact duplicates[136] or up to about 7%.[137] A 2023 study showed that when ChatGPT 3.5 turbo was prompted to repeat the same word indefinitely, after a few hundreds of repetitions, it would start outputting excerpts from its training data.[138] Security[edit] Some commenters expressed concern over accidental or deliberate creation of misinformation, or other forms of misuse.[139] For example, the availability of large language models could reduce the skill-level required to commit bioterrorism; biosecurity researcher Kevin Esvelt has suggested that LLM creators should exclude from their training data papers on creating or enhancing pathogens.[140] The potential presence of "sleeper agents" within LLMs is another emerging security concern. These are hidden functionalities built into the model that remain dormant until triggered by a specific event or condition. Upon activation, the LLM deviates from its expected behavior to make insecure actions.[141] LLM applications accessible to the public, like ChatGPT or Claude, typically incorporate safety measures designed to filter out harmful content. However, implementing these controls effectively has proven challenging. For instance, a 2023 study[142] proposed a method for circumventing LLM safety systems. In 2025, The American Sunlight Project, a non-profit, published a study[143] showing evidence that the so-called Pravda network, a pro-Russia propaganda aggregator, was strategically placing web content through mass publication and duplication with the intention of biasing LLM outputs. The American Sunlight Project coined this technique "LLM grooming," and pointed to it as a new tool of weaponizing AI to spread disinformation and harmful content.[143][144] Similarly, Yongge Wang[145] illustrated in 2024 how a potential criminal could potentially bypass ChatGPT 4o's safety controls to obtain information on establishing a drug trafficking operation. External filters, circuit breakers and overrides have been posed as solutions.[citation needed] Algorithmic bias[edit] Main article: Algorithmic bias While LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, they are susceptible to inheriting and amplifying biases present in their training data. This can manifest in skewed representations or unfair treatment of different demographics, such as those based on race, gender, language, and cultural groups.[146] Since English data is overrepresented in current large language models' training data, it may also downplay non-English views.[147] Stereotyping[edit] AI models can reinforce a wide range of stereotypes, including those based on gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, religion, or occupation. This can lead to outputs that homogenize, or unfairly generalize or caricature groups of people, sometimes in harmful or derogatory ways.[148][149] Notably, gender bias refers to the tendency of these models to produce outputs that are unfairly prejudiced towards one gender over another. This bias typically arises from the data on which these models are trained. Large language models often assign roles and characteristics based on traditional gender norms.[146] For example, it might associate nurses or secretaries predominantly with women and engineers or CEOs with men.[150] Selection bias[edit] Selection bias refers the inherent tendency of large language models to favor certain option identifiers irrespective of the actual content of the options. This bias primarily stems from token bias that is, the model assigns a higher a priori probability to specific answer tokens (such as  A ) when generating responses. As a result, when the ordering of options is altered (for example, by systematically moving the correct answer to different positions), the model s performance can fluctuate significantly. This phenomenon undermines the reliability of large language models in multiple-choice settings.[151][152] Political bias[edit] Political bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to systematically favor certain political viewpoints, ideologies, or outcomes over others. Language models may also exhibit political biases. Since the training data includes a wide range of political opinions and coverage, the models might generate responses that lean towards particular political ideologies or viewpoints, depending on the prevalence of those views in the data.[153] Energy demands[edit] The energy demands of LLMs have grown along with their size and capabilities. Data centers that enable LLM training require substantial amounts of electricity. Much of that electricity is generated by non-renewable resources that create greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change.[154] Nuclear power and geothermal energy are two options tech companies are exploring to meet the sizable energy demands of LLM training.[155] The significant expense of investing in geothermal solutions has led to major shale producers like Chevron and Exxon Mobil advocating for tech companies to use electricity produced via natural gas to fuel their large energy demands.[156] See also[edit] Foundation models List of large language models List of chatbots Language model benchmark Reinforcement learning Small language model References[edit] ^ a b c Brown, Tom B.; Mann, Benjamin; Ryder, Nick; Subbiah, Melanie; Kaplan, Jared; Dhariwal, Prafulla; Neelakantan, Arvind; Shyam, Pranav; Sastry, Girish; Askell, Amanda; Agarwal, Sandhini; Herbert-Voss, Ariel; Krueger, Gretchen; Henighan, Tom; Child, Rewon; Ramesh, Aditya; Ziegler, Daniel M.; Wu, Jeffrey; Winter, Clemens; Hesse, Christopher; Chen, Mark; Sigler, Eric; Litwin, Mateusz; Gray, Scott; Chess, Benjamin; Clark, Jack; Berner, Christopher; McCandlish, Sam; Radford, Alec; Sutskever, Ilya; Amodei, Dario (Dec 2020).

Generative AI explained Generative artificial intelligence, or GenAI, uses sophisticated algorithms to organize large, complex data sets into meaningful clusters of information to create new content, including text, images and audio, in response to a query or prompt. While the technology is still in relatively early -- and volatile -- days, progress thus far has already resulted in generative AI fundamentally changing enterprise technology and transforming how businesses operate. This guide takes a deeper look at how GenAI works and its implications, with hyperlinks throughout to guide you to articles, tips and definitions providing even more detailed explanations. By Sean Michael Kerner A large language model is a type of artificial intelligence algorithm that uses deep learning techniques and massively large data sets to understand, summarize, generate and predict new content. The term generative AI also is closely connected with LLMs, which are, in fact, a type of generative AI that has been specifically architected to help generate text-based content. Over millennia, humans developed spoken languages to communicate. Language is at the core of all forms of human and technological communications; it provides the words, semantics and grammar needed to convey ideas and concepts. In the AI world, a language model serves a similar purpose, providing a basis to communicate and generate new concepts. The first AI language models trace their roots to the earliest days of AI. The Eliza language model debuted in 1966 at MIT and is one of the earliest examples of an AI language model. All language models are first trained on a set of data, then make use of various techniques to infer relationships before ultimately generating new content based on the trained data. Language models are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) applications where a user inputs a query in natural language to generate a result. An LLM is the evolution of the language model concept in AI that dramatically expands the data used for training and inference. In turn, it provides a massive increase in the capabilities of the AI model. While there isn't a universally accepted figure for how large the data set for training needs to be, an LLM typically has at least one billion or more parameters. Parameters are a machine learning term for the variables present in the model on which it was trained that can be used to infer new content. This article is part of What is GenAI? Generative AI explained Which also includes: 8 top generative AI tool categories for 2025 Will AI replace jobs? 18 job types that might be affected 25 of the best large language models in 2025 Modern LLMs emerged in 2017 and use transformer models, which are neural networks commonly referred to as transformers. With a large number of parameters and the transformer model, LLMs are able to understand and generate accurate responses rapidly, which makes the AI technology broadly applicable across many different domains. Some LLMs are referred to as foundation models, a term coined by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence in 2021. A foundation model is so large and impactful that it serves as the foundation for further optimizations and specific use cases. GPT-4, an LLM, dwarfs all predecessors in terms of its parameter count. Examples of LLMs Here is a list of the top 10 LLMs on the market, listed in alphabetical order based on internet research: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, commonly referred to as Bert. Claude. Cohere. Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration, or Ernie. Falcon 40B. Galactica. Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3, commonly known as GPT-3. GPT-3.5. GPT-4. Language Model for Dialogue Applications, or Lamda. For more information, read this article exploring the LLMs noted above and other prominent examples. Why are LLMs becoming important to businesses? As AI continues to grow, its place in the business setting becomes increasingly dominant. This is shown through the use of LLMs as well as machine learning tools. In the process of composing and applying machine learning models, research advises that simplicity and consistency should be among the main goals. Identifying the issues that must be solved is also essential, as is comprehending historical data and ensuring accuracy. The benefits associated with machine learning are often grouped into four categories: efficiency, effectiveness, experience and business evolution. As these continue to emerge, businesses invest in this technology. How do large language models work? LLMs take a complex approach that involves multiple components. At the foundational layer, an LLM needs to be trained on a large volume -- sometimes referred to as a corpus -- of data that is typically petabytes in size. The training can take multiple steps, usually starting with an unsupervised learning approach. In that approach, the model is trained on unstructured data and unlabeled data. The benefit of training on unlabeled data is that there is often vastly more data available. At this stage, the model begins to derive relationships between different words and concepts. The next step for some LLMs is training and fine-tuning with a form of self-supervised learning. Here, some data labeling has occurred, assisting the model to more accurately identify different concepts. Next, the LLM undertakes deep learning as it goes through the transformer neural network process. The transformer model architecture enables the LLM to understand and recognize the relationships and connections between words and concepts using a self-attention mechanism. That mechanism is able to assign a score, commonly referred to as a weight, to a given item -- called a token -- in order to determine the relationship. Once an LLM has been trained, a base exists on which the AI can be used for practical purposes. By querying the LLM with a prompt, the AI model inference can generate a response, which could be an answer to a question, newly generated text, summarized text or a sentiment analysis report. This is a diagram of the architecture for a transformer model. What are large language models used for? LLMs have become increasingly popular because they have broad applicability for a range of NLP tasks, including the following: Text generation. The ability to generate text on any topic that the LLM has been trained on is a primary use case. Translation. For LLMs trained on multiple languages, the ability to translate from one language to another is a common feature. Content summary. Summarizing blocks or multiple pages of text is a useful function of LLMs. Rewriting content. Rewriting a section of text is another capability. Classification and categorization. An LLM is able to classify and categorize content. Sentiment analysis. Most LLMs can be used for sentiment analysis to help users to better understand the intent of a piece of content or a particular response. Conversational AI and chatbots. LLMs can enable a conversation with a user in a way that is typically more natural than older generations of AI technologies. Among the most common uses for conversational AI is through a chatbot, which can exist in any number of different forms where a user interacts in a query-and-response model. The most widely used LLM-based AI chatbot is ChatGPT, which is developed by OpenAI. ChatGPT currently is based on the GPT-3.5 model, although paying subscribers can use the newer GPT-4 LLM. What are the advantages of large language models? There are numerous advantages that LLMs provide to organizations and users: Extensibility and adaptability. LLMs can serve as a foundation for customized use cases. Additional training on top of an LLM can create a finely tuned model for an organization's specific needs. Flexibility. One LLM can be used for many different tasks and deployments across organizations, users and applications. Performance. Modern LLMs are typically high-performing, with the ability to generate rapid, low-latency responses. Accuracy. As the number of parameters and the volume of trained data grow in an LLM, the transformer model is able to deliver increasing levels of accuracy. Ease of training. Many LLMs are trained on unlabeled data, which helps to accelerate the training process. Efficiency. LLMs can save employees time by automating routine tasks. What are the challenges and limitations of large language models? While there are many advantages to using LLMs, there are also several challenges and limitations: Development costs. To run, LLMs generally require large quantities of expensive graphics processing unit hardware and massive data sets. Operational costs. After the training and development period, the cost of operating an LLM for the host organization can be very high. Bias. A risk with any AI trained on unlabeled data is bias, as it's not always clear that known bias has been removed. Ethical concerns. LLMs can have issues around data privacy and create harmful content. Explainability. The ability to explain how an LLM was able to generate a specific result is not easy or obvious for users. Hallucination. AI hallucination occurs when an LLM provides an inaccurate response that is not based on trained data. Complexity. With billions of parameters, modern LLMs are exceptionally complicated technologies that can be particularly complex to troubleshoot. Glitch tokens. Maliciously designed prompts that cause an LLM to malfunction, known as glitch tokens, are part of an emerging trend since 2022. Security risks. LLMs can be used to improve phishing attacks on employees. What are the different types of large language models? There is an evolving set of terms to describe the different types of large language models. Among the common types are the following: Zero-shot model. This is a large, generalized model trained on a generic corpus of data that is able to give a fairly accurate result for general use cases, without the need for additional training. GPT-3 is often considered a zero-shot model. Fine-tuned or domain-specific models. Additional training on top of a zero-shot model such as GPT-3 can lead to a fine-tuned, domain-specific model. One example is OpenAI Codex, a domain-specific LLM for programming based on GPT-3. Language representation model. One example of a language representation model is Google's Bert, which makes use of deep learning and transformers well suited for NLP. Multimodal model. Originally LLMs were specifically tuned just for text, but with the multimodal approach it is possible to handle both text and images. GPT-4 is an example of this type of model. For more on generative AI, read the following articles: Generative AI challenges that businesses should consider Generative AI ethics: Biggest concerns Generative AI landscape: Potential future trends History of generative AI innovations spans 9 decades How to detect AI-generated content The future of large language models The future of LLMs is still being written by the humans who are developing the technology, though there could be a future in which the LLMs write themselves, too. The next generation of LLMs will not likely be artificial general intelligence or sentient in any sense of the word, but they will continuously improve and get "smarter." LLMs will also continue to expand in terms of the business applications they can handle. Their ability to translate content across different contexts will grow further, likely making them more usable by business users with different levels of technical expertise. LLMs will continue to be trained on ever larger sets of data, and that data will increasingly be better filtered for accuracy and potential bias, partly through the addition of fact-checking capabilities. It's also likely that LLMs of the future will do a better job than the current generation when it comes to providing attribution and better explanations for how a given result was generated. Enabling more accurate information through domain-specific LLMs developed for individual industries or functions is another possible direction for the future of large language models. Expanded use of techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, which OpenAI uses to train ChatGPT, could help improve the accuracy of LLMs too. There's also a class of LLMs based on the concept known as retrieval-augmented generation -- including Google's Realm, which is short for Retrieval-Augmented Language Model -- that will enable training and inference on a very specific corpus of data, much like how a user today can specifically search content on a single site. There's also ongoing work to optimize the overall size and training time required for LLMs, including development of Meta's Llama model. Llama 2, which was released in July 2023, has less than half the parameters than GPT-3 has and a fraction of the number GPT-4 contains, though its backers claim it can be more accurate. On the other hand, the use of large language models could drive new instances of shadow IT in organizations. CIOs will need to implement usage guardrails and provide training to avoid data privacy problems and other issues. LLMs could also create new cybersecurity challenges by enabling attackers to write more persuasive and realistic phishing emails or other malicious communications. Nonetheless, the future of LLMs will likely remain bright as the technology continues to evolve in ways that help improve human productivity.

CloseOptimizing Large Language Models - Duke MIDS Optimizing Large Language Models Partner: Proofpoint Industries: Media Year: 2024 Our project addressed the significant challenge of reducing computational and storage costs associated with the deployment of large language models (LLMs) at Proofpoint. Recognizing the vital role of LLMs in enhancing the detection and mitigation of cyber threats across emails, documents, and other communication channels, our team embarked on a mission to compress these models. Our objective was to achieve cost-efficiency by minimizing the model size and inference speed without compromising their performance capabilities. This pursuit was motivated by the pressing need to manage the considerable expenses tied to operating LLMs, as exemplified by the substantial daily costs incurred by similar operations at scale. Our solution involved a meticulous experimental design that leveraged state-of-the-art compression techniques, including pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, applied both individually and in combination. We focused our efforts on BERT and 1B-LLM models, utilizing multilabel and multiclass classification datasets to evaluate our strategies  effectiveness. The results were promising: we achieved up to a 2.35 times increase in inference speed and a 6.64 times reduction in model size, with minimal impact on accuracy. These improvements were critical for Proofpoint, enabling more efficient and cost-effective deployment of LLMs for cybersecurity purposes. By significantly reducing computational and storage requirements, our work supports the scalable application of LLMs in detecting and mitigating cyber threats, providing substantial business value to our client. Through detailed documentation and the development of optimization scripts for cross-platform interoperability, we have laid a foundation for future advancements and broader applicability of our findings.

How can AWS help with LLMs? What are Large Language Models? Large language models, also known as LLMs, are very large deep learning models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data. The underlying transformer is a set of neural networks that consist of an encoder and a decoder with self-attention capabilities. The encoder and decoder extract meanings from a sequence of text and understand the relationships between words and phrases in it. Transformer LLMs are capable of unsupervised training, although a more precise explanation is that transformers perform self-learning. It is through this process that transformers learn to understand basic grammar, languages, and knowledge. Unlike earlier recurrent neural networks (RNN) that sequentially process inputs, transformers process entire sequences in parallel. This allows the data scientists to use GPUs for training transformer-based LLMs, significantly reducing the training time. Transformer neural network architecture allows the use of very large models, often with hundreds of billions of parameters. Such large-scale models can ingest massive amounts of data, often from the internet, but also from sources such as the Common Crawl, which comprises more than 50 billion web pages, and Wikipedia, which has approximately 57 million pages. Read more about neural networks   Read more about deep learning   Why are large language models important? Large language models are incredibly flexible. One model can perform completely different tasks such as answering questions, summarizing documents, translating languages and completing sentences. LLMs have the potential to disrupt content creation and the way people use search engines and virtual assistants. While not perfect, LLMs are demonstrating a remarkable ability to make predictions based on a relatively small number of prompts or inputs. LLMs can be used for generative AI (artificial intelligence) to produce content based on input prompts in human language. LLMs are big, very big. They can consider billions of parameters and have many possible uses. Here are some examples: Open AI's GPT-3 model has 175 billion parameters. Its cousin, ChatGPT, can identify patterns from data and generate natural and readable output. While we don t know the size of Claude 2, it can take inputs up to 100K tokens in each prompt, which means it can work over hundreds of pages of technical documentation or even an entire book. AI21 Labs  Jurassic-1 model has 178 billion parameters and a token vocabulary of 250,000-word parts and similar conversational capabilities. Cohere s Command model has similar capabilities and can work in more than 100 different languages. LightOn's Paradigm offers foundation models with claimed capabilities that exceed those of GPT-3. All these LLMs come with APIs that allow developers to create unique generative AI applications. Read more about generative AI   Read more about foundation models   How do large language models work? A key factor in how LLMs work is the way they represent words. Earlier forms of machine learning used a numerical table to represent each word. But, this form of representation could not recognize relationships between words such as words with similar meanings. This limitation was overcome by using multi-dimensional vectors, commonly referred to as word embeddings, to represent words so that words with similar contextual meanings or other relationships are close to each other in the vector space. Using word embeddings, transformers can pre-process text as numerical representations through the encoder and understand the context of words and phrases with similar meanings as well as other relationships between words such as parts of speech. It is then possible for LLMs to apply this knowledge of the language through the decoder to produce a unique output. What are applications of large language models? There are many practical applications for LLMs. Copywriting Apart from GPT-3 and ChatGPT, Claude, Llama 2, Cohere Command, and Jurassiccan write original copy. AI21 Wordspice suggests changes to original sentences to improve style and voice. Knowledge base answering Often referred to as knowledge-intensive natural language processing (KI-NLP), the technique refers to LLMs that can answer specific questions from information help in digital archives. An example is the ability of AI21 Studio playground to answer general knowledge questions. Text classification Using clustering, LLMs can classify text with similar meanings or sentiments. Uses include measuring customer sentiment, determining the relationship between texts, and document search. Code generation LLM are proficient in code generation from natural language prompts. Examples include Amazon CodeWhisperer and Open AI's codex used in GitHub Copilot, which can code in Python, JavaScript, Ruby and several other programming languages. Other coding applications include creating SQL queries, writing shell commands and website design. Learn more about AI code generation. Text generation Similar to code generation, text generation can complete incomplete sentences, write product documentation or, like Alexa Create, write a short children's story. How are large language models trained? Transformer-based neural networks are very large. These networks contain multiple nodes and layers. Each node in a layer has connections to all nodes in the subsequent layer, each of which has a weight and a bias. Weights and biases along with embeddings are known as model parameters. Large transformer-based neural networks can have billions and billions of parameters. The size of the model is generally determined by an empirical relationship between the model size, the number of parameters, and the size of the training data. Training is performed using a large corpus of high-quality data. During training, the model iteratively adjusts parameter values until the model correctly predicts the next token from an the previous squence of input tokens. It does this through self-learning techniques which teach the model to adjust parameters to maximize the likelihood of the next tokens in the training examples. Once trained, LLMs can be readily adapted to perform multiple tasks using relatively small sets of supervised data, a process known as fine tuning. Three common learning models exist: Zero-shot learning; Base LLMs can respond to a broad range of requests without explicit training, often through prompts, although answer accuracy varies. Few-shot learning: By providing a few relevant training examples, base model performance significantly improves in that specific area. Fine-tuning: This is an extension of few-shot learning in that data scientists train a base model to adjust its parameters with additional data relevant to the specific application. What is the future of LLMs? The introduction of large language models like ChatGPT, Claude 2, and Llama 2 that can answer questions and generate text points to exciting possibilities in the future. Slowly, but surely, LLMs are moving closer to human-like performance. The immediate success of these LLMs demonstrates a keen interest in robotic-type LLMs that emulate and, in some contexts, outperform the human brain. Here are some thoughts on the future of LLMs, Increased capabilities As impressive as they are, the current level of technology is not perfect and LLMs are not infallible. However, newer releases will have improved accuracy and enhanced capabilities as developers learn how to improve their performance while reducing bias and eliminating incorrect answers. Audiovisual training While developers train most LLMs using text, some have started training models using video and audio input. This form of training should lead to faster model development and open up new possibilities in terms of using LLMs for autonomous vehicles. Workplace transformation LLMs are a disruptive factor that will change the workplace. LLMs will likely reduce monotonous and repetitive tasks in the same way that robots did for repetitive manufacturing tasks. Possibilities include repetitive clerical tasks, customer service chatbots, and simple automated copywriting. Conversational AI LLMs will undoubtedly improve the performance of automated virtual assistants like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. They will be better able to interpret user intent and respond to sophisticated commands. Read more about conversational AI How can AWS help with LLMs?

It has since led most of America's space exploration programs, including Project Mercury, Project Gemini, the 1968 1972 Apollo program missions, the Skylab space station, and the Space Shuttle. Currently, NASA supports the International Space Station (ISS) along with the Commercial Crew Program, and oversees the development of the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System for the lunar Artemis program. NASA's science division is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System; advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program; exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft such as New Horizons and planetary rovers such as Perseverance; and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the James Webb Space Telescope, the four Great Observatories, and associated programs. The Launch Services Program oversees launch operations for its uncrewed launches. History Creation Main articles: Creation of NASA and National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics A US Air Force Bell X-1 test flight NASA traces its roots to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). Despite being the birthplace of aviation, by 1914 the United States recognized that it was far behind Europe in aviation capability. Determined to regain American leadership in aviation, the United States Congress created the Aviation Section of the US Army Signal Corps in 1914 and established NACA in 1915 to foster aeronautical research and development. Over the next forty years, NACA would conduct aeronautical research in support of the US Air Force, US Army, US Navy, and the civil aviation sector. After the end of World War II, NACA became interested in the possibilities of guided missiles and supersonic aircraft, developing and testing the Bell X-1 in a joint program with the US Air Force. NACA's interest in space grew out of its rocketry program at the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division.[4] Launch of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency's Explorer 1, America's first satellite The Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1 ushered in the Space Age and kicked off the Space Race. Despite NACA's early rocketry program, the responsibility for launching the first American satellite fell to the Naval Research Laboratory's Project Vanguard, whose operational issues ensured the Army Ballistic Missile Agency would launch Explorer 1, America's first satellite, on February 1, 1958. The Eisenhower Administration decided to split the United States's military and civil spaceflight programs, which were organized together under the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency. NASA was established on July 29, 1958, with the signing of the National Aeronautics and Space Act and it began operations on October 1, 1958.[4] As the US's premier aeronautics agency, NACA formed the core of NASA's new structure by reassigning 8,000 employees and three major research laboratories. NASA also proceeded to absorb the Naval Research Laboratory's Project Vanguard, the Army's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and the Army Ballistic Missile Agency under Wernher von Braun. This left NASA firmly as the United States's civil space lead and the Air Force as the military space lead.[4] First orbital and hypersonic flights Main article: Project Mercury Launch of Friendship 7, NASA's first orbital flight, February 20, 1962 Plans for human spaceflight began in the US Armed Forces prior to NASA's creation. The Air Force's Man in Space Soonest project formed in 1956,[5] coupled with the Army's Project Adam, served as the foundation for Project Mercury. NASA established the Space Task Group to manage the program,[6] which would conduct crewed sub-orbital flights with the Army's Redstone rockets and orbital flights with the Air Force's Atlas launch vehicles. While NASA intended for its first astronauts to be civilians, President Eisenhower directed that they be selected from the military. The Mercury 7 astronauts included three Air Force pilots, three Navy aviators, and one Marine Corps pilot.[4] The NASA-Air Force X-15 hypersonic aircraft On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American to enter space, performing a suborbital spaceflight in the Freedom 7.[7] This flight occurred less than a month after the Soviet Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space, executing a full orbital spaceflight. NASA's first orbital spaceflight was conducted by John Glenn on February 20, 1962, in the Friendship 7, making three full orbits before reentering. Glenn had to fly parts of his final two orbits manually due to an autopilot malfunction.[8] The sixth and final Mercury mission was flown by Gordon Cooper in May 1963, performing 22 orbits over 34 hours in the Faith 7.[9] The Mercury Program was wildly recognized as a resounding success, achieving its objectives to orbit a human in space, develop tracking and control systems, and identify other issues associated with human spaceflight.[4] While much of NASA's attention turned to space, it did not put aside its aeronautics mission. Early aeronautics research attempted to build upon the X-1's supersonic flight to build an aircraft capable of hypersonic flight. The North American X-15 was a joint NASA US Air Force program,[10] with the hypersonic test aircraft becoming the first non-dedicated spacecraft to cross from the atmosphere to outer space. The X-15 also served as a testbed for Apollo program technologies, as well as ramjet and scramjet propulsion.[4] Moon landing Main articles: Project Gemini and Apollo program Gemini 6 and Gemini 7 conduct an orbital rendezvous Escalations in the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union prompted President John F. Kennedy to charge NASA with landing an American on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth by the end of the 1960s and installed James E. Webb as NASA administrator to achieve this goal.[11] On May 25, 1961, President Kennedy openly declared this goal in his "Urgent National Needs" speech to the United States Congress, declaring: I believe this Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish. Kennedy gave his "We choose to go to the Moon" speech the next year, on September 12, 1962 at Rice University, where he addressed the nation hoping to reinforce public support for the Apollo program.[12] Despite attacks on the goal of landing astronauts on the Moon from the former president Dwight Eisenhower and 1964 presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, President Kennedy was able to protect NASA's growing budget, of which 50% went directly to human spaceflight and it was later estimated that, at its height, 5% of Americans worked on some aspect of the Apollo program.[4] Launch of Apollo 11 Mirroring the Department of Defense's program management concept using redundant systems in building the first intercontinental ballistic missiles, NASA requested the Air Force assign Major General Samuel C. Phillips to the space agency where he would serve as the director of the Apollo program. Development of the Saturn V rocket was led by Wernher von Braun and his team at the Marshall Space Flight Center, derived from the Army Ballistic Missile Agency's original Saturn I. The Apollo spacecraft was designed and built by North American Aviation, while the Apollo Lunar Module was designed and built by Grumman.[4] To develop the spaceflight skills and equipment required for a lunar mission, NASA initiated Project Gemini.[13] Using a modified Air Force Titan II launch vehicle, the Gemini capsule could hold two astronauts for flights of over two weeks. Gemini pioneered the use of fuel cells instead of batteries, and conducted the first American spacewalks and rendezvous operations. Buzz Aldrin salutes the United States flag on the lunar surface. The Ranger Program was started in the 1950s as a response to Soviet lunar exploration, however most missions ended in failure. The Lunar Orbiter program had greater success, mapping the surface in preparation for Apollo landings, conducting meteoroid detection, and measuring radiation levels. The Surveyor program conducted uncrewed lunar landings and takeoffs, as well as taking surface and regolith observations.[4] Despite the setback caused by the Apollo 1 fire, which killed three astronauts, the program proceeded. Apollo 8 was the first crewed spacecraft to leave low Earth orbit and the first human spaceflight to reach the Moon. The crew orbited the Moon ten times on December 24 and 25, 1968, and then traveled safely back to Earth.[14][15][16] The three Apollo 8 astronauts Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders were the first humans to see the Earth as a globe in space, the first to witness an Earthrise, and the first to see and manually photograph the far side of the Moon. The first lunar landing was conducted by Apollo 11. Commanded by Neil Armstrong with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, Apollo 11 was one of the most significant missions in NASA's history, marking the end of the Space Race when the Soviet Union gave up its lunar ambitions. As the first human to step on the surface of the Moon, Neil Armstrong uttered the now famous words: That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. NASA would conduct six total lunar landings as part of the Apollo program, with Apollo 17 concluding the program in 1972.[4] End of Apollo Apollo 15 CSM Endeavour in lunar orbit Wernher von Braun had advocated for NASA to develop a space station since the agency was created. In 1973, following the end of the Apollo lunar missions, NASA launched its first space station, Skylab, on the final launch of the Saturn V. Skylab reused a significant amount of Apollo and Saturn hardware, with a repurposed Saturn V third stage serving as the primary module for the space station. Damage to Skylab during its launch required spacewalks to be performed by the first crew to make it habitable and operational. Skylab hosted nine missions and was decommissioned in 1974 and deorbited in 1979, two years prior to the first launch of the Space Shuttle and any possibility of boosting its orbit.[4] In 1975, the Apollo Soyuz mission was the first ever international spaceflight and a major diplomatic accomplishment between the Cold War rivals, which also marked the last flight of the Apollo capsule.[4] Flown in 1975, a US Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soviet Soyuz capsule. Interplanetary exploration and space science Image from Mars taken by the Viking 2 lander. During the 1960s, NASA started its space science and interplanetary probe program. The Mariner program was its flagship program, launching probes to Venus, Mars, and Mercury in the 1960s.[17][18] The Jet Propulsion Laboratory was the lead NASA center for robotic interplanetary exploration, making significant discoveries about the inner planets. Despite these successes, Congress was unwilling to fund further interplanetary missions and NASA Administrator James Webb suspended all future interplanetary probes to focus resources on the Apollo program.[4] Following the conclusion of the Apollo program, NASA resumed launching interplanetary probes and expanded its space science program. The first planet tagged for exploration was Venus, sharing many similar characteristics to Earth. First visited by American Mariner 2 spacecraft,[19] Venus was observed to be a hot and inhospitable planet. Follow-on missions included the Pioneer Venus project in the 1970s and Magellan, which performed radar mapping of Venus' surface in the 1980s and 1990s. Future missions were flybys of Venus, on their way to other destinations in the Solar System.[4] Mars has long been a planet of intense fascination for NASA, being suspected of potentially having harbored life. Mariner 5 was the first NASA spacecraft to flyby Mars,[20] followed by Mariner 6 and Mariner 7. Mariner 9 was the first orbital mission to Mars. Launched in 1975, Viking program consisted of two landings on Mars in 1976. Follow-on missions would not be launched until 1996, with the Mars Global Surveyor orbiter and Mars Pathfinder, deploying the first Mars rover, Sojourner.[21] During the early 2000s, the 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter reached the planet and in 2004 the Sprit and Opportunity rovers landed on the Red Planet. This was followed in 2005 by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and 2007 Phoenix Mars lander. The 2012 landing of Curiosity discovered that the radiation levels on Mars were equal to those on the International Space Station, greatly increasing the possibility of Human exploration, and observed the key chemical ingredients for life to occur. In 2013, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission observed the Martian upper atmosphere and space environment and in 2018, the Interior exploration using Seismic Investigations Geodesy, and Heat Transport (InSight) studied the Martian interior. The 2021 Perseverance rover carried the first extraplanetary aircraft, a helicopter named Ingenuity.[4] NASA also launched missions to Mercury in 2004, with the MESSENGER probe demonstrating as the first use of a solar sail.[22] NASA also launched probes to the outer Solar System starting in the 1960s. Pioneer 10 was the first probe to the outer planets, flying by Jupiter, while Pioneer 11 provided the first close up view of the planet. Both probes became the first objects to leave the Solar System. The Voyager program launched in 1977, conducting flybys of Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus on a trajectory to leave the Solar System.[23] The Galileo spacecraft, deployed from the Space Shuttle flight STS-34, was the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, discovering evidence of subsurface oceans on the Europa and observed that the moon may hold ice or liquid water.[24] A joint NASA-European Space Agency-Italian Space Agency mission, Cassini Huygens, was sent to Saturn's moon Titan, which, along with Mars and Europa, are the only celestial bodies in the Solar System suspected of being capable of harboring life.[25] Cassini discovered three new moons of Saturn and the Huygens probe entered Titan's atmosphere. The mission discovered evidence of liquid hydrocarbon lakes on Titan and subsurface water oceans on the moon of Enceladus, which could harbor life. Finally launched in 2006, the New Horizons mission was the first spacecraft to visit Pluto and the Kuiper Belt.[4] Beyond interplanetary probes, NASA has launched many space telescopes. Launched in the 1960s, the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory were NASA's first orbital telescopes,[26] providing ultraviolet, gamma-ray, x-ray, and infrared observations. NASA launched the Orbiting Geophysical Observatory in the 1960s and 1970s to look down at Earth and observe its interactions with the Sun. The Uhuru satellite was the first dedicated x-ray telescope, mapping 85% of the sky and discovering a large number of black holes.[4] The Hubble Space Telescope in Low Earth Orbit Launched in the 1990s and early 2000s, the Great Observatories program are among NASA's most powerful telescopes. The Hubble Space Telescope was launched in 1990 on STS-31 from the Discovery and could view galaxies 15 billion light years away.[27] A major defect in the telescope's mirror could have crippled the program, had NASA not used computer enhancement to compensate for the imperfection and launched five Space Shuttle servicing flights to replace the damaged components. The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory was launched from the Atlantis on STS-37 in 1991, discovering a possible source of antimatter at the center of the Milky Way and observing that the majority of gamma-ray bursts occur outside of the Milky Way galaxy. The Chandra X-ray Observatory was launched from the Columbia on STS-93 in 1999, observing black holes, quasars, supernova, and dark matter. It provided critical observations on the Sagittarius A* black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy and the separation of dark and regular matter during galactic collisions. Finally, the Spitzer Space Telescope is an infrared telescope launched in 2003 from a Delta II rocket. It is in a trailing orbit around the Sun, following the Earth and discovered the existence of brown dwarf stars.[4] Other telescopes, such as the Cosmic Background Explorer and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, provided evidence to support the Big Bang.[28] The James Webb Space Telescope, named after the NASA administrator who lead the Apollo program, is an infrared observatory launched in 2021. The James Webb Space Telescope is a direct successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, intended to observe the formation of the first galaxies.[29] Other space telescopes include the Kepler space telescope, launched in 2009 to identify planets orbiting extrasolar stars that may be Terran and possibly harbor life. The first exoplanet that the Kepler space telescope confirmed was Kepler-22b, orbiting within the habitable zone of its star.[4] NASA also launched a number of different satellites to study Earth, such as Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) in 1960, which was the first weather satellite.[30] NASA and the United States Weather Bureau cooperated on future TIROS and the second generation Nimbus program of weather satellites. It also worked with the Environmental Science Services Administration on a series of weather satellites and the agency launched its experimental Applications Technology Satellites into geosynchronous orbit. NASA's first dedicated Earth observation satellite, Landsat, was launched in 1972. This led to NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration jointly developing the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite and discovering Ozone depletion.[4] Space Shuttle Main article: Space Shuttle Launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery on STS-120 NASA had been pursuing spaceplane development since the 1960s, blending the administration's dual aeronautics and space missions. NASA viewed a spaceplane as part of a larger program, providing routine and economical logistical support to a space station in Earth orbit that would be used as a hub for lunar and Mars missions. A reusable launch vehicle would then have ended the need for expensive and expendable boosters like the Saturn V.[4] In 1969, NASA designated the Johnson Space Center as the lead center for the design, development, and manufacturing of the Space Shuttle orbiter, while the Marshall Space Flight Center would lead the development of the launch system. NASA's series of lifting body aircraft, culminating in the joint NASA-US Air Force Martin Marietta X-24, directly informed the development of the Space Shuttle and future hypersonic flight aircraft. Official development of the Space Shuttle began in 1972, with Rockwell International contracted to design the orbiter and engines, Martin Marietta for the external fuel tank, and Morton Thiokol for the solid rocket boosters.[31] NASA acquired six orbiters: the Enterprise, Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour[4] The Space Shuttle program also allowed NASA to make major changes to its Astronaut Corps. While almost all previous astronauts were Air Force or Naval test pilots, the Space Shuttle allowed NASA to begin recruiting more non-military scientific and technical experts. A prime example is Sally Ride, who became the first American woman to fly in space on STS-7. This new astronaut selection process also allowed NASA to accept exchange astronauts from US allies and partners for the first time.[4] The first Space Shuttle flight occurred in 1981, when the Columbia launched on the STS-1 mission, designed to serve as a flight test for the new spaceplane.[32] NASA intended for the Space Shuttle to replace expendable launch systems like the Air Force's Atlas, Delta, and Titan and the European Space Agency's Ariane. The Space Shuttle's Spacelab payload, developed by the European Space Agency, increased the scientific capabilities of shuttle missions over anything NASA was able to previously accomplish.[4] Space Shuttle Discovery in Low Earth Orbit on STS-120 NASA launched its first commercial satellites on the STS-5 mission and in 1984, the STS-41-C mission conducted the world's first on-orbit satellite servicing mission when the Challenger captured and repaired the malfunctioning Solar Maximum Mission satellite. It also had the capability to return malfunctioning satellite to Earth, like it did with the Palapa B2 and Westar 6 satellites. Once returned to Earth, the satellites were repaired and relaunched.[4] Despite ushering in a new era of spaceflight, where NASA was contracting launch services to commercial companies, the Space Shuttle was criticized for not being as reusable and cost-effective as advertised. In 1986, Challenger disaster on the STS-51L mission resulted in the loss of the spacecraft and all seven astronauts on launch, grounding the entire space shuttle fleet for 36 months and forced the 44 commercial companies that contracted with NASA to deploy their satellites to return to expendable launch vehicles.[33] When the Space Shuttle returned to flight with the STS-26 mission, it had undergone significant modifications to improve its reliability and safety.[4] An Air Force Space Command Defense Support Program missile warning spacecraft deploys from the Space Shuttle Atlantis on the STS-44 mission. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation and United States initiated the Shuttle-Mir program.[34] The first Russian cosmonaut flew on the STS-60 mission in 1994 and the Discovery rendezvoused, but did not dock with, the Russian Mir in the STS-63 mission. This was followed by Atlantis' STS-71 mission where it accomplished the initial intended mission for the Space Shuttle, docking with a space station and transferring supplies and personnel. The Shuttle-Mir program would continue until 1998, when a series of orbital accidents on the space station spelled an end to the program.[4] In 2003, a second space shuttle was destroyed when the Columbia was destroyed upon reentry during the STS-107 mission, resulting in the loss of the spacecraft and all seven astronauts.[35] This accident marked the beginning of the retiring of the Space Shuttle program, with President George W. Bush directing that upon the completion of the International Space Station, the space shuttle be retired. In 2006, the Space Shuttle returned to flight, conducting several mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope, but was retired following the STS-135 resupply mission to the International Space Station in 2011. Space stations Main articles: Space Station Freedom and International Space Station Skylab seen on the Skylab 4 mission NASA never gave up on the idea of a space station after Skylab's reentry in 1979. The agency began lobbying politicians to support building a larger space station as soon as the Space Shuttle began flying, selling it as an orbital laboratory, repair station, and a jumping off point for lunar and Mars missions. NASA found a strong advocate in President Ronald Reagan, who declared in a 1984 speech: America has always been greatest when we dared to be great. We can reach for greatness again. We can follow our dreams to distant stars, living and working in space for peaceful, economic, and scientific gain. Tonight I am directing NASA to develop a permanently manned space station and to do it within a decade. In 1985, NASA proposed the Space Station Freedom, which both the agency and President Reagan intended to be an international program.[36] While this would add legitimacy to the program, there were concerns within NASA that the international component would dilute its authority within the project, having never been willing to work with domestic or international partners as true equals. There was also a concern with sharing sensitive space technologies with the Europeans, which had the potential to dilute America's technical lead. Ultimately, an international agreement to develop the Space Station Freedom program would be signed with thirteen countries in 1985, including the European Space Agency member states, Canada, and Japan.[4] Despite its status as the first international space program, the Space Station Freedom was controversial, with much of the debate centering on cost. Several redesigns to reduce cost were conducted in the early 1990s, stripping away much of its functions. Despite calls for Congress to terminate the program, it continued, in large part because by 1992 it had created 75,000 jobs across 39 states. By 1993, President Bill Clinton attempted to significantly reduce NASA's budget and directed costs be significantly reduced, aerospace industry jobs were not lost, and the Russians be included.[4] The International Space Station seen from the Space Shuttle Atlantis on the STS-132 mission. In 1993, the Clinton Administration announced that the Space Station Freedom would become the International Space Station in an agreement with the Russian Federation.[37] This allowed the Russians to maintain their space program through an infusion of American currency to maintain their status as one of the two premier space programs. While the United States built and launched the majority of the International Space Station, Russia, Canada, Japan, and the European Space Agency all contributed components. Despite NASA's insistence that costs would be kept at a budget of $17.4, they kept rising and NASA had to transfer funds from other programs to keep the International Space Station solvent. Ultimately, the total cost of the station was $150 billion, with the United States paying for two-thirds.Following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003, NASA was forced to rely on Russian Soyuz launches for its astronauts and the 2011 retirement of the Space Shuttle accelerated the station's completion.[4] In the 1980s, right after the first flight of the Space Shuttle, NASA started a joint program with the Department of Defense to develop the Rockwell X-30 National Aerospace Plane. NASA realized that the Space Shuttle, while a massive technological accomplishment, would not be able to live up to all its promises. Designed to be a single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane, the X-30 had both civil and military applications. With the end of the Cold War, the X-30 was canceled in 1992 before reaching flight status.[4] Unleashing commercial space and return to the Moon Main articles: Commercial Crew Program and Artemis program Following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003, President Bush started the Constellation program to smoothly replace the Space Shuttle and expand space exploration beyond low Earth orbit.[38] Constellation was intended to use a significant amount of former Space Shuttle equipment and return astronauts to the Moon. This program was canceled by the Obama Administration. Former astronauts Neil Armstrong, Gene Cernan, and Jim Lovell sent a letter to President Barack Obama to warn him that if the United States did not get new human spaceflight ability, the US risked become a second or third-rate space power.[4] As early as the Reagan Administration, there had been calls for NASA to expand private sector involvement in space exploration rather than do it all in-house. In the 1990s, NASA and Lockheed Martin entered into an agreement to develop the Lockheed Martin X-33 demonstrator of the VentureStar spaceplane, which was intended to replace the Space Shuttle.[39] Due to technical challenges, the spacecraft was cancelled in 2001. Despite this, it was the first time a commercial space company directly expended a significant amount of its resources into spacecraft development. The advent of space tourism also forced NASA to challenge its assumption that only governments would have people in space. The first space tourist was Dennis Tito, an American investment manager and former aerospace engineer who contracted with the Russians to fly to the International Space Station for four days, despite the opposition of NASA to the idea.[4] Advocates of this new commercial approach for NASA included former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who remarked that it would return NASA to its roots as a research and development agency, with commercial entities actually operating the space systems. Having corporations take over orbital operations would also allow NASA to focus all its efforts on deep space exploration and returning humans to the Moon and going to Mars. Embracing this approach, NASA's Commercial Crew Program started by contracting cargo delivery to the International Space Station and flew its first operational contracted mission on SpaceX Crew-1. This marked the first time since the retirement of the Space Shuttle that NASA was able to launch its own astronauts on an American spacecraft from the United States, ending a decade of reliance on the Russians.[4] In 2019, NASA announced the Artemis program, intending to return to the Moon and establish a permanent human presence.[40] This was paired with the Artemis Accords with partner nations to establish rules of behavior and norms of space commercialization on the Moon.[41] In 2023, NASA established the Moon to Mars Program office. The office is designed to oversee the various projects, mission architectures and associated timelines relevant to lunar and Mars exploration and science.[42] Active programs Human spaceflight International Space Station (1993 present) Further information: International Space Station The International Space Station as seen from Space Shuttle Endeavour during STS-134 The International Space Station (ISS) combines NASA's Space Station Freedom project with the Russian Mir-2 station, the European Columbus station, and the Japanese Kib  laboratory module.[43] NASA originally planned in the 1980s to develop Freedom alone, but US budget constraints led to the merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993, managed by NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).[44][45] The station consists of pressurized modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other components, which were manufactured in various factories around the world and launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and the American Space Shuttle.[43] The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, the completion of the US Orbital Segment occurred in 2009 and the completion of the Russian Orbital Segment occurred in 2010. The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements,[46] which divide the station into two areas and allow Russia to retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment (with the exception of Zarya),[47][48] with the US Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners.[46] Long-duration missions to the ISS are referred to as ISS Expeditions. Expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the ISS.[49] The initial expedition crew size was three, temporarily decreased to two following the Columbia disaster. Between May 2009 and until the retirement of the Space Shuttle, the expedition crew size has been six crew members.[50] As of 2024, though the Commercial Program's crew capsules can allow a crew of up to seven, expeditions using them typically consist of a crew of four. The ISS has been continuously occupied for the past 24 years and 196 days, having exceeded the previous record held by Mir; and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations.[51][52] The station can be seen from the Earth with the naked eye and, as of 2025, is the largest artificial satellite in Earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station.[53] The Russian Soyuz and American Dragon and Starliner spacecraft are used to send astronauts to and from the ISS. Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft provide service to the ISS; they are the Russian Progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000, the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) since 2008, the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) since 2009, the (uncrewed) Dragon since 2012, and the American Cygnus spacecraft since 2013.[54][55] The Space Shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay. Between the retirement of the Shuttle in 2011 and the commencement of crewed Dragon flights in 2020, American astronauts exclusively used the Soyuz for crew transport to and from the ISS[56] The highest number of people occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions.[57] The ISS program is expected to continue until 2030,[58] after which the space station will be retired and destroyed in a controlled de-orbit.[59] Commercial Resupply Services (2008 present) Further information: Commercial Resupply Services DragonCygnusCommercial Resupply Services missions approaching International Space Station Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) are a contract solution to deliver cargo and supplies to the International Space Station on a commercial basis by private companies.[60] NASA signed its first CRS contracts in 2008 and awarded $1.6 billion to SpaceX for twelve cargo Dragon and $1.9 billion to Orbital Sciences[note 1] for eight Cygnus flights, covering deliveries until 2016. Both companies evolved or created their launch vehicle products to launch the spacecrafts (SpaceX with The Falcon 9 and Orbital with the Antares). SpaceX flew its first operational resupply mission (SpaceX CRS-1) in 2012.[61] Orbital Sciences followed in 2014 (Cygnus CRS Orb-1).[62] In 2015, NASA extended CRS-1 to twenty flights for SpaceX and twelve flights for Orbital ATK.[note 1][63][64] A second phase of contracts (known as CRS-2) was solicited in 2014; contracts were awarded in January 2016 to Orbital ATK[note 1] Cygnus, Sierra Nevada Corporation Dream Chaser, and SpaceX Dragon 2, for cargo transport flights beginning in 2019 and expected to last through 2024. In March 2022, NASA awarded an additional six CRS-2 missions each to both SpaceX and Northrop Grumman (formerly Orbital).[65] Northrop Grumman successfully delivered Cygnus NG-17 to the ISS in February 2022.[66] In July 2022, SpaceX launched its 25th CRS flight (SpaceX CRS-25) and successfully delivered its cargo to the ISS.[67] The Dream Chaser spacecraft is currently scheduled for its Demo-1 launch in the first half of 2024.[68] Commercial Crew Program (2011 present) Further information: Commercial Crew Program The Crew Dragon (left) and Starliner (right) approaching the ISS on their respective missions The Commercial Crew Program (CCP) provides commercially operated crew transportation service to and from the International Space Station (ISS) under contract to NASA, conducting crew rotations between the expeditions of the International Space Station program. American space manufacturer SpaceX began providing service in 2020, using the Crew Dragon spacecraft,[69] while Boeing's Starliner spacecraft began providing service in 2024.[70][71][72] NASA has contracted for six operational missions from Boeing and fourteen from SpaceX, ensuring sufficient support for ISS through 2030.[73] The spacecraft are owned and operated by the vendor, and crew transportation is provided to NASA as a commercial service.[74] Each mission sends up to four astronauts to the ISS, with an option for a fifth passenger available. Operational flights occur approximately once every six months for missions that last for approximately six months. A spacecraft remains docked to the ISS during its mission, and missions usually overlap by at least a few days. Between the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011 and the first operational CCP mission in 2020, NASA relied on the Soyuz program to transport its astronauts to the ISS. A Crew Dragon spacecraft is launched to space atop a Falcon 9 Block 5 launch vehicle and the capsule returns to Earth via splashdown in the ocean near Florida. The program's first operational mission, SpaceX Crew-1, launched on November 16, 2020.[75] Boeing Starliner operational flights will now commence with Boeing Starliner-1 which will launched atop an Atlas V N22 launch vehicle. Instead of a splashdown, Starliner capsules return on land with airbags at one of four designated sites in the western United States.[76] Artemis (2017 present) Further information: Artemis program Launch of Artemis I Since 2017, NASA's crewed spaceflight program has been the Artemis program, which involves the help of US commercial spaceflight companies and international partners such as ESA, JAXA, and CSA.[77] The goal of this program is to land "the first woman and the next man" on the lunar south pole region by 2025. Artemis would be the first step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon, laying the foundation for companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually sending humans to Mars. The Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle was held over from the canceled Constellation program for Artemis. Artemis I was the uncrewed initial launch of Space Launch System (SLS) that would also send an Orion spacecraft on a Distant Retrograde Orbit.[78] The first tentative steps of returning to crewed lunar missions will be Artemis II, which is to include the Orion crew module, propelled by the SLS, and is expected to launch no later than April 2026.[79][77][80] This mission is to be a 10-day mission planned to briefly place a crew of four into a Lunar flyby.[81] Artemis III aims to conduct the first crewed lunar landing since Apollo 17, and is scheduled for no earlier than mid-2027.[citation needed] In support of the Artemis missions, NASA has been funding private companies to land robotic probes on the lunar surface in a program known as the Commercial Lunar Payload Services. As of March 2022, NASA has awarded contracts for robotic lunar probes to companies such as Intuitive Machines, Firefly Space Systems, and Astrobotic.[82] On April 16, 2021, NASA announced they had selected the SpaceX Lunar Starship as its Human Landing System. The agency's Space Launch System rocket will launch four astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft for their multi-day journey to lunar orbit where they will transfer to SpaceX's Starship for the final leg of their journey to the surface of the Moon.[83] In November 2021, it was announced that the goal of landing astronauts on the Moon by 2024 had slipped to no earlier than 2027 due to numerous factors. Artemis I launched on November 16, 2022, and returned to Earth safely on December 11, 2022. As of April 2025, NASA plans to launch Artemis II in April 2026.[84] and Artemis III in 2027.[85] Additional Artemis missions, Artemis IV, Artemis V, and Artemis VI are planned to launch between 2028 and 2031.[86] NASA's next major space initiative is the construction of the Lunar Gateway, a small space station in lunar orbit.[87] This space station will be designed primarily for non-continuous human habitation. The construction of the Gateway is expected to begin in 2027 with the launch of the first two modules: the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) and the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO).[88] Operations on the Gateway will begin with the Artemis IV mission, which plans to deliver a crew of four to the Gateway in 2028. In 2017, NASA was directed by the congressional NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017 to get humans to Mars-orbit (or to the Martian surface) by the 2030s.[89][90] Commercial LEO Development (2021 present) Further information: Commercial LEO Destinations program The Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations program is an initiative by NASA to support work on commercial space stations that the agency hopes to have in place by the end of the current decade to replace the "International Space Station". The three selected companies are: Blue Origin (et al.) with their Orbital Reef station concept, Nanoracks (et al.) with their Starlab Space Station concept, and Northrop Grumman with a station concept based on the HALO-module for the Gateway station.[91] Robotic exploration Further information: List of NASA missions and List of uncrewed NASA missions Video of many of the uncrewed missions used to explore the outer reaches of space NASA has conducted many uncrewed and robotic spaceflight programs throughout its history. More than 1,000 uncrewed missions have been designed to explore the Earth and the Solar System.[92] Mission selection process NASA executes a mission development framework to plan, select, develop, and operate robotic missions. This framework defines cost, schedule and technical risk parameters to enable competitive selection of missions involving mission candidates that have been developed by principal investigators and their teams from across NASA, the broader US Government research and development stakeholders, and industry. The mission development construct is defined by four umbrella programs.[93] Explorer program Further information: Explorers Program The Explorer program derives its origin from the earliest days of the US Space program. In current form, the program consists of three classes of systems   Small Explorers (SMEX), Medium Explorers (MIDEX), and University-Class Explorers (UNEX) missions. The NASA Explorer program office provides frequent flight opportunities for moderate cost innovative solutions from the heliophysics and astrophysics science areas. The Small Explorer missions are required to limit cost to NASA to below $150M (2022 dollars). Medium class explorer missions have typically involved NASA cost caps of $350M. The Explorer program office is based at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.[94] Discovery program Further information: Discovery Program The NASA Discovery program develops and delivers robotic spacecraft solutions in the planetary science domain. Discovery enables scientists and engineers to assemble a team to deliver a solution against a defined set of objectives and competitively bid that solution against other candidate programs. Cost caps vary but recent mission selection processes were accomplished using a $500M cost cap for NASA. The Planetary Mission Program Office is based at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and manages both the Discovery and New Frontiers missions. The office is part of the Science Mission Directorate.[95] NASA Administrator Bill Nelson announced on June 2, 2021, that the DAVINCI+ and VERITAS missions were selected to launch to Venus in the late 2020s, having beat out competing proposals for missions to Jupiter's volcanic moon Io and Neptune's large moon Triton that were also selected as Discovery program finalists in early 2020. Each mission has an estimated cost of $500 million, with launches expected between 2028 and 2030. Launch contracts will be awarded later in each mission's development.[96] New Frontiers program Further information: New Frontiers program The New Frontiers program focuses on specific Solar System exploration goals identified as top priorities by the planetary science community. Primary objectives include Solar System exploration employing medium class spacecraft missions to conduct high-science-return investigations. New Frontiers builds on the development approach employed by the Discovery program but provides for higher cost caps and schedule durations than are available with Discovery. Cost caps vary by opportunity; recent missions have been awarded based on a defined cap of $1 billion. The higher cost cap and projected longer mission durations result in a lower frequency of new opportunities for the program   typically one every several years. OSIRIS-REx and New Horizons are examples of New Frontiers missions.[97] NASA has determined that the next opportunity to propose for the fifth round of New Frontiers missions will occur no later than the fall of 2024. Missions in NASA's New Frontiers Program tackle specific Solar System exploration goals identified as top priorities by the planetary science community. Exploring the Solar System with medium-class spacecraft missions that conduct high-science-return investigations is NASA's strategy to further understand the Solar System.[98] Large strategic missions Further information: Large strategic science missions Large strategic missions (formerly called Flagship missions) are strategic missions that are typically developed and managed by large teams that may span several NASA centers. The individual missions become the program as opposed to being part of a larger effort (see Discovery, New Frontiers, etc.). The James Webb Space Telescope is a strategic mission that was developed over a period of more than 20 years. Strategic missions are developed on an ad-hoc basis as program objectives and priorities are established. Missions like Voyager, had they been developed today, would have been strategic missions. Three of the Great Observatories were strategic missions (the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and the Hubble Space Telescope). Europa Clipper is the next large strategic mission in development by NASA.[99] Planetary science missions Curiosity on the surface of Mars NASA continues to play a material role in exploration of the Solar System as it has for decades. Ongoing missions have current science objectives with respect to more than five extraterrestrial bodies within the Solar System   Moon (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter), Mars (Perseverance rover), Jupiter (Juno), asteroid Bennu (OSIRIS-REx), and Kuiper Belt Objects (New Horizons). The Juno extended mission will make multiple flybys of the Jovian moon Io in 2023 and 2024 after flybys of Ganymede in 2021 and Europa in 2022. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 continue to provide science data back to Earth while continuing on their outward journeys into interstellar space. On November 26, 2011, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission was successfully launched for Mars. The Curiosity rover successfully landed on Mars on August 6, 2012, and subsequently began its search for evidence of past or present life on Mars.[100][101][102] In September 2014, NASA's MAVEN spacecraft, which is part of the Mars Scout Program, successfully entered Mars orbit and, as of October 2022, continues its study of the atmosphere of Mars.[103][104] NASA's ongoing Mars investigations include in-depth surveys of Mars by the Perseverance rover. NASA's Europa Clipper, launched in October 2024, will study the Galilean moon Europa through a series of flybys while in orbit around Jupiter. Dragonfly will send a mobile robotic rotorcraft to Saturn's biggest moon, Titan.[105] As of May 2021, Dragonfly is scheduled for launch in June 2027.[106][107] Astrophysics missions NASA astrophysics spacecraft fleet, credit NASA GSFC, 2022 The NASA Science Mission Directorate Astrophysics division manages the agency's astrophysics science portfolio. NASA has invested significant resources in the development, delivery, and operations of various forms of space telescopes. These telescopes have provided the means to study the cosmos over a large range of the electromagnetic spectrum.[108] The Great Observatories that were launched in the 1980s and 1990s have provided a wealth of observations for study by physicists across the planent. The first of them, the Hubble Space Telescope, was delivered to orbit in 1990 and continues to function, in part due to prior servicing missions performed by the Space Shuttle.[109][110] The other remaining active great observatories include the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO), launched by STS-93 in July 1999 and is now in a 64-hour elliptical orbit studying X-ray sources that are not readily viewable from terrestrial observatories.[111] Chandra X-ray Observatory (rendering), 2015 The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) is a space observatory designed to improve the understanding of X-ray production in objects such as neutron stars and pulsar wind nebulae, as well as stellar and supermassive black holes.[112] IXPE launched in December 2021 and is an international collaboration between NASA and the Italian Space Agency (ASI). It is part of the NASA Small Explorers program (SMEX) which designs low-cost spacecraft to study heliophysics and astrophysics.[113] The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory was launched in November 2004 and is a gamma-ray burst observatory that also monitors the afterglow in X-ray, and UV/Visible light at the location of a burst.[114] The mission was developed in a joint partnership between Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and an international consortium from the United States, United Kingdom, and Italy. Pennsylvania State University operates the mission as part of NASA's Medium Explorer program (MIDEX).[115] The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST) is another gamma-ray focused space observatory that was launched to low Earth orbit in June 2008 and is being used to perform gamma-ray astronomy observations.[116] In addition to NASA, the mission involves the United States Department of Energy, and government agencies in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Sweden.[117] The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), launched in December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket, operates in a halo orbit circling the Sun-Earth L2 point.[118][119][120] JWST's high sensitivity in the infrared spectrum and its imaging resolution will allow it to view more distant, faint, or older objects than its predecessors, including Hubble.[121] Earth Sciences Program missions (1965 present) Further information: NASA Earth Science Schematic of NASA Earth Science Division operating satellite missions as of February 2015 NASA Earth Science is a large, umbrella program comprising a range of terrestrial and space-based collection systems in order to better understand the Earth system and its response to natural and human-caused changes. Numerous systems have been developed and fielded over several decades to provide improved prediction for weather, climate, and other changes in the natural environment. Several of the current operating spacecraft programs include: Aqua,[122] Aura,[123] Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2),[124] Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-on (GRACE FO),[125] and Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2).[126] In addition to systems already in orbit, NASA is designing a new set of Earth Observing Systems to study, assess, and generate responses for climate change, natural hazards, forest fires, and real-time agricultural processes.[127] The GOES-T satellite (designated GOES-18 after launch) joined the fleet of US geostationary weather monitoring satellites in March 2022.[128] NASA also maintains the Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) program to oversee the life cycle of NASA's Earth science data   from acquisition through processing and distribution. The primary goal of ESDS is to maximize the scientific return from NASA's missions and experiments for research and applied scientists, decision makers, and society at large.[129] The Earth Science program is managed by the Earth Science Division of the NASA Science Mission Directorate. Space operations architecture NASA invests in various ground and space-based infrastructures to support its science and exploration mandate. The agency maintains access to suborbital and orbital space launch capabilities and sustains ground station solutions to support its evolving fleet of spacecraft and remote systems. Deep Space Network (1963 present) Further information: NASA Deep Space Network The NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) serves as the primary ground station solution for NASA's interplanetary spacecraft and select Earth-orbiting missions.[130] The system employs ground station complexes near Barstow, California, in Spain near Madrid, and in Australia near Canberra. The placement of these ground stations approximately 120 degrees apart around the planet provides the ability for communications to spacecraft throughout the Solar System even as the Earth rotates about its axis on a daily basis. The system is controlled at a 24x7 operations center at JPL in Pasadena, California, which manages recurring communications linkages with up to 40 spacecraft.[131] The system is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.[130] Near Space Network (1983 present) Further information: Near Earth Network and Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System Near Earth Network Ground Stations, 2021 The Near Space Network (NSN) provides telemetry, commanding, ground-based tracking, data and communications services to a wide range of customers with satellites in low earth orbit (LEO), geosynchronous orbit (GEO), highly elliptical orbits (HEO), and lunar orbits. The NSN accumulates ground station and antenna assets from the Near-Earth Network and the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRS) which operates in geosynchronous orbit providing continuous real-time coverage for launch vehicles and low earth orbit NASA missions.[132] The NSN consists of 19 ground stations worldwide operated by the US Government and by contractors including Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), Swedish Space Corporation (SSC), and South African National Space Agency (SANSA).[133] The ground network averages between 120 and 150 spacecraft contacts a day with TDRS engaging with systems on a near-continuous basis as needed; the system is managed and operated by the Goddard Space Flight Center.[134] Sounding Rocket Program (1959 present) Further information: NASA Sounding Rocket Program NASA sounding rocket launch from the Wallops Flight Facility The NASA Sounding Rocket Program (NSRP) is located at the Wallops Flight Facility and provides launch capability, payload development and integration, and field operations support to execute suborbital missions.[135] The program has been in operation since 1959 and is managed by the Goddard Space Flight Center using a combined US Government and contractor team.[136] The NSRP team conducts approximately 20 missions per year from both Wallops and other launch locations worldwide to allow scientists to collect data "where it occurs". The program supports the strategic vision of the Science Mission Directorate collecting important scientific data for earth science, heliophysics, and astrophysics programs.[135] In June 2022, NASA conducted its first rocket launch from a commercial spaceport outside the US. It launched a Black Brant IX from the Arnhem Space Centre in Australia.[137] Launch Services Program (1990 present) Further information: NASA Launch Services Program The NASA Launch Services Program (LSP) is responsible for procurement of launch services for NASA uncrewed missions and oversight of launch integration and launch preparation activity, providing added quality and mission assurance to meet program objectives.[138] Since 1990, NASA has purchased expendable launch vehicle launch services directly from commercial providers, whenever possible, for its scientific and applications missions. Expendable launch vehicles can accommodate all types of orbit inclinations and altitudes and are ideal vehicles for launching Earth-orbit and interplanetary missions. LSP operates from Kennedy Space Center and falls under the NASA Space Operations Mission Directorate (SOMD).[139][140] Aeronautics Research Further information: NASA research and Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate The Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) is one of five mission directorates within NASA, the other four being the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, the Space Operations Mission Directorate, the Science Mission Directorate, and the Space Technology Mission Directorate.[141] The ARMD is responsible for NASA's aeronautical research, which benefits the commercial, military, and general aviation sectors. ARMD performs its aeronautics research at four NASA facilities: Ames Research Center and Armstrong Flight Research Center in California, Glenn Research Center in Ohio, and Langley Research Center in Virginia.[142] NASA X-57 Maxwell aircraft (2016 present) Further information: NASA X-57 Maxwell The NASA X-57 Maxwell is an experimental aircraft being developed by NASA to demonstrate the technologies required to deliver a highly efficient all-electric aircraft.[143] The primary goal of the program is to develop and deliver all-electric technology solutions that can also achieve airworthiness certification with regulators. The program involves development of the system in several phases, or modifications, to incrementally grow the capability and operability of the system. The initial configuration of the aircraft has now completed ground testing as it approaches its first flights. In mid-2022, the X-57 was scheduled to fly before the end of the year.[144] The development team includes staff from the NASA Armstrong, Glenn, and Langley centers along with number of industry partners from the United States and Italy.[145] Next Generation Air Transportation System (2007 present) Further information: Next Generation Air Transportation System NASA is collaborating with the Federal Aviation Administration and industry stakeholders to modernize the United States National Airspace System (NAS). Efforts began in 2007 with a goal to deliver major modernization components by 2025.[146] The modernization effort intends to increase the safety, efficiency, capacity, access, flexibility, predictability, and resilience of the NAS while reducing the environmental impact of aviation.[147] The Aviation Systems Division of NASA Ames operates the joint NASA/FAA North Texas Research Station. The station supports all phases of NextGen research, from concept development to prototype system field evaluation. This facility has already transitioned advanced NextGen concepts and technologies to use through technology transfers to the FAA.[146] NASA contributions also include development of advanced automation concepts and tools that provide air traffic controllers, pilots, and other airspace users with more accurate real-time information about the nation's traffic flow, weather, and routing. Ames' advanced airspace modeling and simulation tools have been used extensively to model the flow of air traffic flow across the US, and to evaluate new concepts in airspace design, traffic flow management, and optimization.[148] Technology research For technologies funded or otherwise supported by NASA, see NASA spinoff technologies. Nuclear in-space power and propulsion (ongoing) NASA has made use of technologies such as the multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG), which is a type of radioisotope thermoelectric generator used to power spacecraft.[149] Shortages of the required plutonium-238 have curtailed deep space missions since the turn of the millennium.[150] An example of a spacecraft that was not developed because of a shortage of this material was New Horizons 2.[150] In July 2021, NASA announced contract awards for development of nuclear thermal propulsion reactors. Three contractors will develop individual designs over 12 months for later evaluation by NASA and the US Department of Energy.[151] NASA's space nuclear technologies portfolio are led and funded by its Space Technology Mission Directorate. In January 2023, NASA announced a partnership with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) on the Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO) program to demonstrate a NTR engine in space, an enabling capability for NASA missions to Mars.[152] In July 2023, NASA and DARPA jointly announced the award of $499 million to Lockheed Martin to design and build an experimental NTR rocket to be launched in 2027.[153] Other initiatives Free Space Optics. NASA contracted a third party to study the probability of using Free Space Optics (FSO) to communicate with Optical (laser) Stations on the Ground (OGS) called laser-com RF networks for satellite communications.[154] Water Extraction from Lunar Soil. On July 29, 2020, NASA requested American universities to propose new technologies for extracting water from the lunar soil and developing power systems. The idea will help the space agency conduct sustainable exploration of the Moon.[155] In 2024, NASA was tasked by the US Government to create a Time standard for the Moon. The standard is to be called Coordinated Lunar Time and is expected to be finalized in 2026.[156] Human Spaceflight Research (2005 present) SpaceX Crew-4 astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti operating the rHEALTH ONE on the ISS to address key health risks for space travel. NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) is designed to study the effects of space on human health and also to provide countermeasures and technologies for human space exploration.[157] The medical effects of space exploration are reasonably limited in low Earth orbit or in travel to the Moon. Travel to Mars is significantly longer and deeper into space, significant medical issues can result. These include bone density loss, radiation exposure, vision changes, circadian rhythm disturbances, heart remodeling, and immune alterations. In order to study and diagnose these ill-effects, HRP has been tasked with identifying or developing small portable instrumentation with low mass, volume, and power to monitor the health of astronauts.[158] To achieve this aim, on May 13, 2022, NASA and SpaceX Crew-4 astronauts successfully tested its rHEALTH ONE universal biomedical analyzer for its ability to identify and analyzer biomarkers, cells, microorganisms, and proteins in a spaceflight environment.[159] Planetary Defense (2016 present) Further information: Planetary Defense Coordination Office and Near Earth Objects NASA established the Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) in 2016 to catalog and track potentially hazardous near-Earth objects (NEO), such as asteroids and comets and develop potential responses and defenses against these threats.[160] The PDCO is chartered to provide timely and accurate information to the government and the public on close approaches by Potentially hazardous objects (PHOs) and any potential for impact. The office functions within the Science Mission Directorate Planetary Science Division.[161] The PDCO augmented prior cooperative actions between the United States, the European Union, and other nations which had been scanning the sky for NEOs since 1998 in an effort called Spaceguard.[162] Near Earth object detection (1998 present) From the 1990s NASA has run many NEO detection programs from Earth bases observatories, greatly increasing the number of objects that have been detected. Many asteroids are very dark and those near the Sun are much harder to detect from Earth-based telescopes which observe at night, and thus face away from the Sun. NEOs inside Earth orbit only reflect a part of light also rather than potentially a "full Moon" when they are behind the Earth and fully lit by the Sun.[163] In 1998, the United States Congress gave NASA a mandate to detect 90% of near-Earth asteroids over 1 km (0.62 mi) diameter (that threaten global devastation) by 2008.[164] This initial mandate was met by 2011.[165] In 2005, the original USA Spaceguard mandate was extended by the George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey Act, which calls for NASA to detect 90% of NEOs with diameters of 140 m (460 ft) or greater, by 2020 (compare to the 20-meter Chelyabinsk meteor that hit Russia in 2013).[166] As of January 2020[update], it is estimated that less than half of these have been found, but objects of this size hit the Earth only about once in 2,000 years.[167] In January 2020, NASA officials estimated it would take 30 years to find all objects meeting the 140 m (460 ft) size criteria, more than twice the timeframe that was built into the 2005 mandate.[168] In June 2021, NASA authorized the development of the NEO Surveyor spacecraft to reduce that projected duration to achieve the mandate down to 10 years.[169][170] Involvement in current robotic missions NASA has incorporated planetary defense objectives into several ongoing missions. In 1999, NASA visited 433 Eros with the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft which entered its orbit in 2000, closely imaging the asteroid with various instruments at that time.[171] NEAR Shoemaker became the first spacecraft to successfully orbit and land on an asteroid, improving our understanding of these bodies and demonstrating our capacity to study them in greater detail.[172] OSIRIS-REx used its suite of instruments to transmit radio tracking signals and capture optical images of Bennu during its study of the asteroid that will help NASA scientists determine its precise position in the solar system and its exact orbital path. As Bennu has the potential for recurring approaches to the Earth-Moon system in the next 100 200 years, the precision gained from OSIRIS-REx will enable scientists to better predict the future gravitational interactions between Bennu and our planet and resultant changes in Bennu's onward flight path.[173][174] The WISE/NEOWISE mission was launched by NASA JPL in 2009 as an infrared-wavelength astronomical space telescope. In 2013, NASA repurposed it as the NEOWISE mission to find potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids and comets; its mission has been extended into 2023.[175][176] NASA and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (JHAPL) jointly developed the first planetary defense purpose-built satellite, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) to test possible planetary defense concepts.[177] DART was launched in November 2021 by a SpaceX Falcon 9 from California on a trajectory designed to impact the Dimorphos asteroid. Scientists were seeking to determine whether an impact could alter the subsequent path of the asteroid; a concept that could be applied to future planetary defense.[178] On September 26, 2022, DART hit its target. In the weeks following impact, NASA declared DART a success, confirming it had shortened Dimorphos' orbital period around Didymos by about 32 minutes, surpassing the pre-defined success threshold of 73 seconds.[179][180] NEO Surveyor, formerly called the Near-Earth Object Camera (NEOCam) mission, is a space-based infrared telescope under development to survey the Solar System for potentially hazardous asteroids.[181] The spacecraft is scheduled to launch in 2026. Study of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (2022 present) In June 2022, the head of the NASA Science Mission Directorate, Thomas Zurbuchen, confirmed the start of NASA's UAP independent study team.[182] At a speech before the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, Zurbuchen said the space agency would bring a scientific perspective to efforts already underway by the Pentagon and intelligence agencies to make sense of dozens of such sightings. He said it was "high-risk, high-impact" research that the space agency should not shy away from, even if it is a controversial field of study.[183] Collaboration NASA Advisory Council In response to the Apollo 1 accident, which killed three astronauts in 1967, Congress directed NASA to form an Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) to advise the NASA Administrator on safety issues and hazards in NASA's air and space programs. In the aftermath of the Shuttle Columbia disaster, Congress required that the ASAP submit an annual report to the NASA Administrator and to Congress.[184] By 1971, NASA had also established the Space Program Advisory Council and the Research and Technology Advisory Council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support. In 1977, the latter two were combined to form the NASA Advisory Council (NAC).[185] The NASA Authorization Act of 2014 reaffirmed the importance of ASAP. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Further information: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NASA and NOAA have cooperated for decades on the development, delivery and operation of polar and geosynchronous weather satellites.[186] The relationship typically involves NASA developing the space systems, launch solutions, and ground control technology for the satellites and NOAA operating the systems and delivering weather forecasting products to users. Multiple generations of NOAA Polar orbiting platforms have operated to provide detailed imaging of weather from low altitude.[187] Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) provide near-real-time coverage of the western hemisphere to ensure accurate and timely understanding of developing weather phenomenon.[188] United States Space Force Further information: United States Space Force The United States Space Force (USSF) is the space service branch of the United States Armed Forces, while the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is an independent agency of the United States government responsible for civil spaceflight. NASA and the Space Force's predecessors in the Air Force have a long-standing cooperative relationship, with the Space Force supporting NASA launches out of Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, and Vandenberg Space Force Base, to include range support and rescue operations from Task Force 45.[189] NASA and the Space Force also partner on matters such as defending Earth from asteroids.[190] Space Force members can be NASA astronauts, with Colonel Michael S. Hopkins, the commander of SpaceX Crew-1, commissioned into the Space Force from the International Space Station on December 18, 2020.[191][192][193] In September 2020, the Space Force and NASA signed a memorandum of understanding formally acknowledging the joint role of both agencies. This new memorandum replaced a similar document signed in 2006 between NASA and Air Force Space Command.[194][195] US Geological Survey Further information: United States Geological Survey and Landsat 9 The Landsat program is the longest-running enterprise for acquisition of satellite imagery of Earth. It is a joint NASA / USGS program.[196] On July 23, 1972, the Earth Resources Technology Satellite was launched. This was eventually renamed to Landsat 1 in 1975.[197] The most recent satellite in the series, Landsat 9, was launched on September 27, 2021.[198] The instruments on the Landsat satellites have acquired millions of images. The images, archived in the United States and at Landsat receiving stations around the world, are a unique resource for global change research and applications in agriculture, cartography, geology, forestry, regional planning, surveillance and education, and can be viewed through the US Geological Survey (USGS) "EarthExplorer" website. The collaboration between NASA and USGS involves NASA designing and delivering the space system (satellite) solution, launching the satellite into orbit with the USGS operating the system once in orbit.[196] As of October 2022, nine satellites have been built with eight of them successfully operating in orbit. European Space Agency (ESA) Further information: European Space Agency NASA collaborates with the European Space Agency on a wide range of scientific and exploration requirements.[199] From participation with the Space Shuttle (the Spacelab missions) to major roles on the Artemis program (the Orion Service Module), ESA and NASA have supported the science and exploration missions of each agency. There are NASA payloads on ESA spacecraft and ESA payloads on NASA spacecraft. The agencies have developed joint missions in areas including heliophysics (e.g. Solar Orbiter)[200] and astronomy (Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope).[201] Under the Artemis Gateway partnership, ESA will contribute habitation and refueling modules, along with enhanced lunar communications, to the Gateway.[202][203] NASA and ESA continue to advance cooperation in relation to Earth Science including climate change with agreements to cooperate on various missions including the Sentinel-6 series of spacecraft[204] Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Further information: Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) cooperate on a range of space projects. JAXA is a direct participant in the Artemis program, including the Lunar Gateway effort. JAXA's planned contributions to Gateway include I-Hab's environmental control and life support system, batteries, thermal control, and imagery components, which will be integrated into the module by the European Space Agency (ESA) prior to launch. These capabilities are critical for sustained Gateway operations during crewed and uncrewed time periods.[205][206] JAXA and NASA have collaborated on numerous satellite programs, especially in areas of Earth science. NASA has contributed to JAXA satellites and vice versa. Japanese instruments are flying on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites, and NASA sensors have flown on previous Japanese Earth-observation missions. The NASA-JAXA Global Precipitation Measurement mission was launched in 2014 and includes both NASA- and JAXA-supplied sensors on a NASA satellite launched on a JAXA rocket. The mission provides the frequent, accurate measurements of rainfall over the entire globe for use by scientists and weather forecasters.[207] Roscosmos Further information: Roscosmos NASA and Roscosmos have cooperated on the development and operation of the International Space Station since September 1993.[208] The agencies have used launch systems from both countries to deliver station elements to orbit. Astronauts and Cosmonauts jointly maintain various elements of the station. Both countries provide access to the station via launch systems noting Russia's unique role as the sole provider of delivery of crew and cargo upon retirement of the space shuttle in 2011 and prior to commencement of NASA COTS and crew flights. In July 2022, NASA and Roscosmos signed a deal to share space station flights enabling crew from each country to ride on the systems provided by the other.[209] Current geopolitical conditions in late 2022 make it unlikely that cooperation will be extended to other programs such as Artemis or lunar exploration.[210] Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Further information: ISRO In September 2014, NASA and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) signed a partnership to collaborate on and launch a joint radar mission, the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperature Radar (NISAR) mission. The mission is targeted to launch in 2024. NASA will provide the mission's L-band synthetic aperture radar, a high-rate communication subsystem for science data, GPS receivers, a solid-state recorder and payload data subsystem. ISRO provides the spacecraft bus, the S-band radar, the launch vehicle and associated launch services.[211][212] Artemis Accords Further information: Artemis Accords The Artemis Accords have been established to define a framework for cooperating in the peaceful exploration and exploitation of the Moon, Mars, asteroids, and comets. The accords were drafted by NASA and the US State Department and are executed as a series of bilateral agreements between the United States and the participating countries.[213][214] As of September 2022, 21 countries have signed the accords. They are Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, France, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[215][216] China National Space Administration Further information: Wolf Amendment and China National Space Administration The Wolf Amendment was passed by the US Congress into law in 2011 and prevents NASA from engaging in direct, bilateral cooperation with the Chinese government and China-affiliated organizations such as the China National Space Administration without the explicit authorization from Congress and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The law has been renewed annually since by inclusion in annual appropriations bills.[217] Management Leadership Administrator Janet Petro (2025 present) The agency's administration is located at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC, and provides overall guidance and direction.[218] Except under exceptional circumstances, NASA civil service employees are required to be US citizens.[219] NASA's administrator is nominated by the President of the United States subject to the approval of the US Senate,[220] and serves at the President's pleasure as a senior space science advisor. The current administrator is Janet Petro, appointed as acting administrator by President Donald Trump, since January 20, 2025. The Trump administration has also nominated Jared Isaacman as official administrator of NASA; however, Senate has yet to confirm him to the position.[221][222] Strategic plan NASA operates with four FY2022 strategic goals.[223] Expand human knowledge through new scientific discoveries Extend human presence to the Moon and on towards Mars for sustainable long-term exploration, development, and utilization Catalyze economic growth and drive innovation to address national challenges Enhance capabilities and operations to catalyze current and future mission success Budget Further information: Budget of NASA NASA budget requests are developed by NASA and approved by the administration prior to submission to the US Congress. Authorized budgets are those that have been included in enacted appropriations bills that are approved by both houses of Congress and enacted into law by the US president.[224] NASA fiscal year budget requests and authorized budgets are listed below.

Some hypergolic rocket propellants, such as hydrazine, are highly toxic prior to combustion, but decompose into less toxic compounds after burning. Rockets using hydrocarbon fuels, such as kerosene, release carbon dioxide and soot in their exhaust.[250] Carbon dioxide emissions are insignificant compared to those from other sources; on average, the United States consumed 803 million US gal (3.0 million m3) of liquid fuels per day in 2014, while a single Falcon 9 rocket first stage burns around 25,000 US gallons (95 m3) of kerosene fuel per launch.[251][252] Even if a Falcon 9 were launched every single day, it would only represent 0.006% of liquid fuel consumption (and carbon dioxide emissions) for that day. Additionally, the exhaust from LOx- and LH2- fueled engines, like the SSME, is almost entirely water vapor.[253] NASA addressed environmental concerns with its canceled Constellation program in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act in 2011.[254] In contrast, ion engines use harmless noble gases like xenon for propulsion.[255][256] An example of NASA's environmental efforts is the NASA Sustainability Base. Additionally, the Exploration Sciences Building was awarded the LEED Gold rating in 2010.[257] On May 8, 2003, the Environmental Protection Agency recognized NASA as the first federal agency to directly use landfill gas to produce energy at one of its facilities the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.[258] In 2018, NASA along with other companies including Sensor Coating Systems, Pratt & Whitney, Monitor Coating and UTRC launched the project CAUTION (CoAtings for Ultra High Temperature detectION). This project aims to enhance the temperature range of the Thermal History Coating up to 1,500  C (2,730  F) and beyond. The final goal of this project is improving the safety of jet engines as well as increasing efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions.[259] Climate change NASA also researches and publishes on climate change.[260] Its statements concur with the global scientific consensus that the climate is warming.[261] Bob Walker, who has advised former US President Donald Trump on space issues, has advocated that NASA should focus on space exploration and that its climate study operations should be transferred to other agencies such as NOAA. Former NASA atmospheric scientist J. Marshall Shepherd countered that Earth science study was built into NASA's mission at its creation in the 1958 National Aeronautics and Space Act.[262] NASA won the 2020 Webby People's Voice Award for Green in the category Web.[263] STEM Initiatives Further information: STEM Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa). Since 2011, the ELaNa program has provided opportunities for NASA to work with university teams to test emerging technologies and commercial-off-the-shelf solutions by providing launch opportunities for developed CubeSats using NASA procured launch opportunities.[264] By example, two NASA-sponsored CubeSats launched in June 2022 on a Virgin Orbit LauncherOne vehicle as the ELaNa 39 mission.[265] Cubes in Space. NASA started an annual competition in 2014 named "Cubes in Space".[266] It is jointly organized by NASA and the global education company I Doodle Learning, with the objective of teaching school students aged 11 18 to design and build scientific experiments to be launched into space on a NASA rocket or balloon. On June 21, 2017, the world's smallest satellite, KalamSAT, was launched.[267] Use of the metric system US law requires the International System of Units to be used in all US Government programs, "except where impractical".[268] In 1969, Apollo 11 landed on the Moon using a mix of United States customary units and metric units. In the 1980s, NASA started the transition towards the metric system, but was still using both systems in the 1990s.[269][270] On September 23, 1999, a mixup between NASA's use of SI units and Lockheed Martin Space's use of US units resulted in the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter.[271] In August 2007, NASA stated that all future missions and explorations of the Moon would be done entirely using the SI system. This was done to improve cooperation with space agencies of other countries that already use the metric system.[272] As of 2007, NASA is predominantly working with SI units, but some projects still use US units, and some, including the International Space Station, use a mix of both.[273] Media presence NASA TV Further information: NASA TV Approaching 40 years of service, the NASA TV channel airs content ranging from live coverage of crewed missions to video coverage of significant milestones for operating robotic spacecraft (e.g. rover landings on Mars) and domestic and international launches.[274] The channel is delivered by NASA and is broadcast by satellite and over the Internet. The system initially started to capture archival footage of important space events for NASA managers and engineers and expanded as public interest grew. The Apollo 8 Christmas Eve broadcast while in orbit around the Moon was received by more than a billion people.[275] NASA's video transmission of the Apollo 11 Moon landing was awarded a primetime Emmy in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the landing.[276] The channel is a product of the US Government and is widely available across many television and Internet platforms.[277] NASAcast NASAcast is the official audio and video podcast of the NASA website. Created in late 2005, the podcast service contains the latest audio and video features from the NASA web site, including NASA TV's This Week at NASA and educational materials produced by NASA. Additional NASA podcasts, such as Science@NASA, are also featured and give subscribers an in-depth look at content by subject matter.[278] NASA EDGE NASA EDGE broadcasting live from White Sands Missile Range in 2010 NASA EDGE is a video podcast which explores different missions, technologies and projects developed by NASA. The program was released by NASA on March 18, 2007, and, as of August 2020[update], there have been 200 vodcasts produced. It is a public outreach vodcast sponsored by NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate and based out of the Exploration and Space Operations Directorate at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The NASA EDGE team takes an insider's look at current projects and technologies from NASA facilities around the United States, and it is depicted through personal interviews, on-scene broadcasts, computer animations, and personal interviews with top scientists and engineers at NASA.[note 2] The show explores the contributions NASA has made to society as well as the progress of current projects in materials and space exploration. NASA EDGE vodcasts can be downloaded from the NASA website and from iTunes. In its first year of production, the show was downloaded over 450,000 times. As of February 2010,[update] the average download rate is more than 420,000 per month, with over one million downloads in December 2009 and January 2010.[280] NASA and the NASA EDGE have also developed interactive programs designed to complement the vodcast. The Lunar Electric Rover App allows users to drive a simulated Lunar Electric Rover between objectives, and it provides information about and images of the vehicle.[281] The NASA EDGE Widget provides a graphical user interface for accessing NASA EDGE vodcasts, image galleries, and the program's Twitter feed, as well as a live NASA news feed.[282] Astronomy Picture of the Day This section is an excerpt from Astronomy Picture of the Day.[edit] Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) is a website provided by NASA and Michigan Technological University (MTU). It reads: "Each day a different image or photograph of our universe is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer."[283] The photograph does not necessarily correspond to a celestial event on the exact day that it is displayed, and images are sometimes repeated.[284] These often relate to current events in astronomy and space exploration. The text has several hyperlinks to more pictures and websites for more information. The images are either visible spectrum photographs, images taken at non-visible wavelengths and displayed in false color, video footage, animations, artist's conceptions, or micrographs that relate to space or cosmology. Past images are stored in the APOD Archive, with the first image appearing on June 16, 1995.[285] This initiative has received support from NASA, the National Science Foundation, and MTU. The images are sometimes authored by people or organizations outside NASA, and therefore APOD images are often copyrighted, unlike many other NASA image galleries.[286] NASA+ Main article: NASA+ In July 2023, NASA announced a new streaming service known as NASA+. It launched on November 8, 2023, and has live coverage of launches, documentaries and original programs. According to NASA, it will be free of ads and subscription fees. It will be a part of the NASA app on iOS, Android, Amazon Fire TV, Roku and Apple TV as well as on the web on desktop and mobile devices.[287][288][289] Gallery NASA spacecraft observations of the Solar System Sun image by Solar Dynamics Observatory, 2010 Planet Mercury image by MESSENGER, 2008 Planet Venus image by Mariner 10, 1974 Planet Earth image by Apollo 17 crew, 1972 Moon image by Apollo 8 crew, 1968 Planet Mars image by Viking 1, 1976 Asteroid 433 Eros image by NEAR Shoemaker, 2000 Dwarf planet Ceres image by Dawn, 2015 Planet Jupiter image by Juno, 2019 Moon Io (Jupiter) image by Galileo, 1999 Planet Saturn image by Cassini, 2016 Moon Mimas (Saturn) image by Cassini, 2010 Planet Uranus by Voyager 2, 1986 Moon Miranda (Uranus) image by Voyager 2, 1986 Planet Neptune image by Voyager 2, 1989 Dwarf planet Pluto image by New Horizons, 2015 Moon Charon (Pluto) image by New Horizons, 2015 NASA Great Observatory images Helix Nebula by Spitzer Space Telescope, 2007 1901 GK Persei supernova by Chandra X-ray Observatory, 2015 Carina Nebula by Hubble Space Telescope, 2010 Stephens quintet by James Webb Space Telescope, Jul 2022 NASA spacecraft Comparison of Apollo, Gemini, and Mercury systems[note 3] Surveyor 3, Pete Conrad, and Apollo 12 on the Moon, 1969 Space Shuttle Endeavor in orbit, 2008 Hubble Space Telescope released in orbit after servicing, 2009.
